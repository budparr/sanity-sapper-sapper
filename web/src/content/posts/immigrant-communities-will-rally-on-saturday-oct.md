## Press Conference and Presentation of Border Wall of Remembrance and Resistance” on Monday, Oct. 16th at Union Square

**NEW YORK UNITED FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS**

In the face of recent anti-immigrant legislation passed by Congress, **New York United for Immigrant Rights (NYUIR)**—a coalition of more than 60 immigrant and human rights organizations in the New York metro area—will hold a press briefing to announce the details of its October 21st Rally and Procession to demand **NO DEAL: FULL LEGALIZATION NOW!**

To symbolize the human suffering that will result from an expanded border wall, as well as attempts by the government to create borders in all aspects of our daily lives through draconian immigration enforcement, immigrant leaders, workers and supporters will present a **Border Wall of Remembrance and Resistance** at Union Square. Speakers will be available to provide testimony about the impacts of recent policies on their communities.

### Press Conference Details

**Date:** Monday, October 16

**Time:** 2:00 p.m. 2:40 p.m.

**Where:** Union Square Steps (14th St. between Broadway and Park Ave.)

**Who:** Immigrant leaders, New York metropolitan area residents, and representatives of the faith community, including:

* Brother Joel Magallan, Asociación Tepeyac
* Father Luis Barrios, Episcopalian Ministry
* Aarti Shahani, Families for Freedom
* Manuel Castro, Latin American Integration Center
* Carolyn de Leon, CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities
* Chuck Mohan, Guyanese-American Workers United
* Monami Maulik, Desis Rising Up & Moving

On **Saturday, Oct. 21st**, the immigrant rights movement in New York will declare the beginning of **Round Two** of our communities response to Congress failure to propose and pass a full, fair, and humane legalization bill. Instead, Homeland Security has stepped up its campaign of fear and disappearances through workplace raids and deportations.

The attack on workers rights and immigrants rights reached a new low in Congress this fall. Last month, both Houses passed, and the President recently signed, legislation for a $6 billion wall at the U.S.-Mexico border—certain to add to the death toll of 4,000-plus children, women, and men in the desert. Instead of recognizing and addressing the systemic failures of 20 years of immigration policy, Congressional leaders availed themselves of racist immigration politics in order to avoid their responsibility to formulate real immigration policy.

Leaders, residents, and advocates will invite everyone in the New York metro area to join our campaign for human rights and the soul of American democracy.

_New York United for Immigrant Rights is composed of more than 60 organizations in the New York Metropolitan area, including the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Asociación Tepeyac, Coalition of Immigrant Communities (Washington Heights), Immigrant Communities in Action, May 1st Coalition, Families for Freedom, Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights, and more._
