**New Report Shows Increase in Reported Bullying of Asian Students in NYC**

Press Briefing, September 5 at 10am

_Groups release new student data on bias-based harassment of Asian American students in NYC public schools and school anti-bullying measures_

New York, NY — The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and the Sikh Coalition will hold a press briefing on Thursday, September 5 at 10am to release findings on bias-based harassment of Asian American students in NYC public schools. Asian Americans are the fastest growing population in New York City, and nationally have been found most likely to be targeted in the classroom based on race or religion. AALDEF and Sikh Coalition’s new report reveals that while awareness of bias-based bullying protections has increased, so too have the number of reported incidents. NYC Asian American students will be at the briefing to speak about how they have been affected by the incidents of bullying in NYC schools and the responses they have received from teachers and administration.
