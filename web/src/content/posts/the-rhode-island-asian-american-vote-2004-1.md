#### Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund Releases New Exit Poll Results

New York—The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund released new findings from its national multilingual exit poll of almost 11,000 Asian American voters in the November 2004 Presidential Election, the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind in the nation.

AALDEF's new publication, _The Asian American Vote 2004: A Report on the Multilingual Exit Poll in the 2004 Presidential Election_, provides a snapshot of the voter preferences of Asian Americans in 20 cities in 8 states: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

AALDEF released special analysis on the 44 Rhode Island respondents. All voters were surveyed in Providence in Elmwood, Smith Hill, and West End. Highlights of the findings are:

* **Profile of Respondents.**
  The largest Asian groups surveyed in 2004 were Southeast Asian (84%) and then Filipino (11%). Almost two-thirds (61%) were foreign born. 4% had no formal U.S. education. Almost half (48%) were first-time voters.
* **Asian Americans were largely Democratic voters.**

  More than two-thirds (68%) of Rhode Island Asian Americans were registered Democrats, 18% were not enrolled in any political party, and only 11% were registered Republicans. Asian Americans favored Senator John Kerry over President George W. Bush, 78% to 17%, with 5% voting for other candidates.
* **Economy/jobs was the most important issue influencing Asian Americans vote for President.**
  Overall, the most important issues for voters were Economy/Jobs (25%), followed by Terrorism/Security (20%), and then the War in Iraq, Health Care, and Civil Rights (12% each).
* **The most important civil rights/immigrants right issue to Rhode Island Asian Americans was Deportation/Detention and Racial Profiling.**
  Deportation/ Detention and Racial Profiling were the top choices (17% each), followed by Affirmative Action, Civil Liberties, Legalization of Immigrants, and Voting/Political Representation (12% each). Respondents also selected other issues including—Hate Crimes, Immigration Backlogs, Language Barriers to Services, and Workers Rights—but each were selected by less than 7% of respondents.
* **Asian Americans share common political interests, even across ethnic lines.**
  Regardless of ethnicity, almost all Asian ethnic groups voted as a bloc for the same candidate and identified common reasons for their votes. More enrolled as Democrats and second preference was not to enroll in any political party.
* **Many Asian Americans turned to ethnic media outlets for their main source of news.**
  A quarter (26%) of all respondents got their news about politics and community issues from the ethnic press, rather than from mainstream media outlets. 5% of voters got their news from ethnic media sources in Asian languages.
* **Language assistance and bilingual ballots are needed to preserve access to the vote.**
  A quarter (25%) of Asian Americans expressed that they were limited English proficient. 21% identified English as their native language. A number of jurisdictions voluntarily provided language assistance. In the 2004 elections, about one in five (20%) of all respondents needed some form of language assistance in order to exercise the right to vote, either in the form of interpreters or translated written materials.
* **Asian Americans faced many voting barriers.**
  Hundreds of voters were directed to the wrong poll site and complained of hostile, rude or poorly trained poll workers. Many who did not have to provide identification were required to provide identification. AALDEF poll monitors and pollsters received more than 600 complaints of voting problems.</ul>

Community exit polls paint a different picture of the electorate. Different results are found when exit polls are taken in numerous Asian languages and pollsters resemble the populations they are polling. For example, only 11% of respondents in the poll conducted by the National Election Pool (NEP) were first-time voters, whereas over a third (38%) of all Asian Americans surveyed in AALDEF's 8 state multilingual exit poll were first-time voters. The NEP reported that 54% of Asian Americans voted for Kerry, but AALDEF found that nationally 74% of Asian Americans voted for Kerry. Multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that are regularly overlooked or very different from mainstream voter surveys.

AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. Over 5,000 Asian New Yorkers and 3,000 Asian voters in 4 states (NY, NJ, MA, MI) were surveyed in AALDEF's 2000 and 2002 exit polls, respectively.

The 2004 multilingual exit poll was conducted in 23 Asian languages and dialects. AALDEF worked with several community groups to mobilize 1,200 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the multilingual exit poll and to monitor polling places for incidents of voter discrimination.
