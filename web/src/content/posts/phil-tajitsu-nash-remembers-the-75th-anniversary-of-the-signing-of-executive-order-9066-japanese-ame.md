February 19 is the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by
President Franklin Roosevelt. It was the start of a nightmare for Japanese
Americans who were rounded up and placed in internment camps during World War
II. How did it happen? And could it happen again to another group?

Maryland, a civil rights lawyer, and a board member of the Asian American Legal
Defense and Education Fund.He talks about how Roosevelt came to sign Executive
Order 9066, despite information that should have negated any sense that Japanese
Americans represented a threat.He also talks about how the internment personally
impacted his family.
