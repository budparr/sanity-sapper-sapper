More than Jennifer Lopez’s dress, it was Margaret Cho on the Golden Globes that
made me do a double-take last week. And she was in that sexy North Korean
military drag.

At first glance, I just wasn’t sure it was her. If you’ve seen Cho’s stand-up
shows on cable, you know she’s outrageously tatted, speaks her mind, and is as
amok an Asian American as it gets.

I liked her lampoon of a North Korean general and movie fan. I thought it was
toned down, given the current spikier Cho, but conservative enough for the
venue. So I was shocked to see the reaction she got this past week from people
who actually  thought she was racist.

I talked to her on Friday by phone as she prepared to shoot her new TLC talk
show, “All About Sex” (Saturdays at 11 pm).

> E: Let’s go to the beginning. Did they approach you? Did they say, “Hey Margaret, why don’t you do this for us?”
>
> M: Yes. Well, Tina \[Fey\] asked me to do it a few weeks ago, and I was delighted
> because I love her and love working with her. And so I just came in the day
> before and we worked it out. And I wrote the jokes for like the whole thing and
> we just did it.
>
> E: And it was planned to do the open with the magazine and the selfie or the
> “semi-selfie” with Meryl Streep?
>
> M: Yes.
>
> E: She was in on it?
>
> M: No, not really. But she’s kind of up for whatever, so she was into doing it.
> It was great because we were ready to handle whatever, so it was fine.
>
> E: And Michael Keaton, he was going to take the picture?
>
> M: Yes, so we arranged that beforehand. That worked out well.
>
> E: And \[Benedict\] Cumberbatch, he did his \[photobomb\] thing. That was a
> surprise, or was he supposed to do that?

> M: That was a surprise.
>
> E: It made it even punchier…Tell me about going into this. Any trepidation at all? You knew it was going to be somewhat polarizing?
>
> M: No, I didn’t think there would be any…I thought it was great. I was hearing laughs. I really enjoyed myself. It was a moment to have some fun with my friends, whom I never get to see, so it was great.
>
> E: When I saw you, I said, “That’s Margaret Cho;” it didn’t surprise me considering the edgy nature of your comedy. I thought it was funny, but the reaction was mixed. Do you understand why some people might have felt…negatively?
>
> M: No, I’m not a racist person so I don’t know. It’s only people that are racist

> only Asian person involved in the entire event. And what’s really racist is

> M: No. Wait, there was one Asian cameraman. That’s it. I know him. So that was

>
> M: Right, I don’t know over what. But something.

> E: We’re still fighting for some kind of representation.

> M: Right.

> E: I thought it was incredible to see that cast, Amy Hill, BD Wong, a Lincoln

>
> M: No.
>
> E: It must be frustrating for someone like you.
>
> M: It’s very frustrating.
>
> E: Now 20 years later, we’ve got “Fresh Off the Boat.” Have you seen it? What do

Back to the Globes, free speech, and satire.

Cho said because free speech is being threatened, “it’s important to do jokes
about that kind of stuff and be very aware of the world around you.

I related to Cho some of the free speech her performance inspired, in the form
of the criticism I got after I defended Cho on the [AALDEF blog](/blog/emil-guillermo-margaret-cho-stole-the-show-at-the-golden-globes/).
One comment in particular came from an Asian American English professor in
Wisconsin, who seemed to over-intellectualize the issue to such a degree that I
wasn’t even sure what he was saying. And we were just tweeting.But after
consulting Cliff Notes, I think I understand.

The professor believes it doesn’t matter whether you call it satire or free
speech. If the tools Cho used were the same tools, same stereotypes, used by the
racists, he said, then the result is the same; Asians are lesser beings, making
General Cho no different than Charlie Chan.

If you look at the “absolute value” of a racial image–and discount all the major
differences–I guess it doesn’t matter. The images of white supremacy win. Hence,
we all lose.

Hmm. This is why we have PhDs. It figures an academic would come up with that.
Sounds like a good thesis topic, right alongside “the homosexual themes in Moby
Dick.”

Cho responded: “That’s the dumbest thing. People trying to qualify their racism
by saying that I was trying to be like Charlie Chan. They don’t understand that
I’m actually Asian, I’m actually Korean. That’s the stupidest justification for
their own racism.”

But what if they’re like this English professor, an Asian American? Does she buy
into his belief that using the same stereotypes as the racists actually furthers
white supremacy?

“And therefore people of color can’t make commentary on people of color,
therefore Asian people cannot talk about other Asian people?” Cho responded.
“This is basically saying white people can only talk about white people. That’s
what they’re saying. They’re racist.”

It’s also likely the reason that whites and the white media are happy to leave
us out of things. Under the guise of not wanting to offend anyone, we end up
with this irony. As society gets more diverse, some of our cultural
institutions–in an effort not to be offensive–get blander and whiter by the
moment. It also doesn’t leave much room for real Asian Americans to talk
honestly.

Or take another example: Some Asians may think it’s free speech when they talk
amongst themselves. They’re just too afraid to talk freely in general. But
that’s not free speech, that’s self-censorship in action. And that’s exactly why
First Amendment protections exist–to make sure minority opinions are not
intimidated by the majority.

On any topic. Even talk about sex, which Cho is doing a lot of these days on her
new cable series on TLC on Saturday nights at 11 pm.

“It’s a new kind of role going into a talk show, to be an expert on this
subject, and being from San Francisco, which is a very common thing,” said Cho.
“I’m proud of it.”

Being from San Francisco, I guess having three kids makes me some kind of
expert. But maybe not to the degree of Cho, self-described as polyamorous, which
has nothing to do with a love of polyester.

She’s also is a multi-tasker as the only bi-sexual co-host on the show. So I
asked her whether, among all the different formats she works in, the talk show
allows her the freedom to be who she really is.

“Yeah, I think so,” Cho said. “But they’re all different aspects and types of
performance and they’re all easy for me.”

We ended the conversation with her last line at the Golden Globes. Would she
host the award show as dictated by the general next year? Or was that a joke?

“I don’t know, I’d love to,” she said. “We’ll see.”
