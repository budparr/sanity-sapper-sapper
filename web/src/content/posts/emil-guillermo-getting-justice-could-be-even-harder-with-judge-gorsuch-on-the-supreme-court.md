We already know how hard it is to get justice in America. It might get even
harder.

In my [AALDEF podcast](https://bit.ly/2n74nux), I talk to two Asian American
professors who have filed a discrimination suit against the University of
Michigan.

The professors filed in Michigan state court. But where federal laws are
concerned, anyone seeking justice has to be concerned with Neil Gorsuch.

So far, he’s the odds-on favorite to become the justice who breaks the current
4-4 tie that exists in the High Court.

Given that Democrats don’t have the votes in the Senate to deny Gorsuch’s bid to
the Supreme Court, it makes his confirmation hearings more like an epic uphill
battle.

Much harder than getting Donald Trump to stop tweet-lying.

If you caught any of it on TV, then you know the Trump pick just had to smile
and play a folksy Jimmy Stewart-type.

Unwilling to say anything on issues he may have to rule on, he played dodgeball
at the highest level.

On hot button issues like abortion, Gorsuch did say _Roe v. Wade_ is a precedent
and that he respects precedent. But he added: “I’m not in a position to tell you
whether I’d personally like or dislike any precedent. That’s not relevant to my
job.”

When California’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked if _Roe_ was a “super precedent,”
Gorsuch would only say, “It has been reaffirmed many times.”

But later, when asked what he’d do if Trump had asked him to rule against _Roe_,
Gorsuch seemed so principled: “I would’ve walked out the door. It’s not what
judges do.”

So was it a litmus test on abortion? Maybe? Given his stonewall answers to
serious questions, it was as good as we got.

From the hearings so far, this is what we’ve learned about Gorsuch: He said he’s
human, that he puts his ego aside, and as a judge, he has “one client, it’s the
law.”

He also tried to be funny, in a charming, folksy way. Given how serious he is
and the seriousness of the issues he must opine on, anything he says that’s
slightly less than 100 percent serious deserves at least a chortle.

Not a belly laugh. A chortle.

“We’re all human beings. I get that,” said Gorsuch. “I’m not an algorithm,
although I think eBay is trying.”

See what I mean? A chortle.

So he’s not all that funny.

And, as it turns out, not all that human either.

Just ask the family of the late Grace Hwang.

**_WHAT GORSUCH DID TO GRACE HWANG_**

Hwang, an immigrant from Taiwan who capped a long career in corporate law by
becoming a university professor at Kansas State, was also a much-loved [board member of AALDEF](/press-release/remembering-grace-hwang-1956-2016/).

![Grace2.jpg](/uploads/Grace2.jpg)

After a nearly ten-year struggle with cancer, she died last year at age 60.

In an opinion piece that ran in the _[San Francisco
Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Judge-Gorsuch-failed-our-family-11001615.php)_
on March 14, the Hwang family talked about how Grace continued to work through
her illnesses and treatment.

Even when it was found she had leukemia, Grace continued teaching from her
hospital bed.

After a six-month paid leave to deal with her illness, she wanted to go back to
work. Her family said due to a flu epidemic on campus, Grace had asked that her
leave be extended.

But Kansas State rejected the idea and said she couldn’t work from home.

Grace sued the school, claiming the university violated the law requiring an
accommodation for her disability.

With her job and life on the line, Grace took the matter to the 10th Circuit and
encountered Judge Gorsuch.

In May 2014, Gorsuch wrote the opinion siding with the school and ruled that the
purpose of federal law was “not to turn employers into safety net providers for
those who cannot work,” and that the six months’ leave she already had received
was “more than sufficient.”

So much for Gorsuch the human being.

At the hearing Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) brought up the case.

Here’s Gorsuch’s response:

> I can’t remember if it was Kansas or Kansas State, she was asking for another
> six months off and the university said no, and she sued under the Rehabilitation
> Act, which prescribes that reasonable accommodations must be provided to workers
> to perform their essential job functions. But to prevail they have to show they
> can perform their essential job functions. It was undisputed in that case that
> she just couldn’t, through no fault of their own. And the district court said
> that’s just not a claim under the Rehabilitation Act. Maybe for breach of
> contract or something else, not under federal statutory law, that’s my
> recollection sitting here.

Undisputed that she couldn’t work? Not according to the Hwang family, who still
claim Grace was able to work if she had been allowed to do so from home.

The family called Gorsuch’s ruling a “callous disregard for Grace and her
condition.”

And it’s not an isolated case.

Several senators brought up the TransAm Trucking case, also known as the “frozen
trucker” case, in which driver Alphonse Maddin abandoned his truck in freezing
conditions and risked hypothermia to get gas. He was fired by his company for
disobeying orders.

Maddin sued and won in the 10th Circuit; there was one dissenter.

Gorsuch found for the company, which astonished Sen. Al Franken (D-MN).

“I made a career in identifying absurdity,” said Franken, who laid out the case
in detail at the hearing. “It makes me question your judgment.”

It was one of the few times Gorsuch seemed bothered.

The rest of the time, it was softballs like the ones thrown to him by that
fun-loving guy, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). He asked Gorsuch about his love of the
rodeo and its practice of “mutton busting,” where children and animals are
abused for kicks.

![muttonbusting2.jpg](/uploads/muttonbusting2.jpg)Guns? Abortion? It was that
mutton busting question that was more revealing than we know. Terrorizing kids
and woolly sheep? The human that is Gorsuch just couldn’t stop talking about
that.

That and his judge’s black polyester robe, his symbol of his commoner’s touch.

Still, there was just enough in his past opinions to paint an unflattering
picture.

Here’s a judge who has easily betrayed the common man and woman seeking justice
from the law.

Just ask the frozen trucker and the family of Grace Hwang.

**_PROFESSORS SUE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR DISCRIMINATION_**

This brings us back to our podcast episode involving two married Asian American
professors, Scott Kurashige and Emily Lawsin, who filed a discrimination suit
against the University of Michigan in December that was just made public this
month.

Kurashige was a full professor with tenure, and director of the Asian Pacific
Islander American Studies program until he was fired in 2013 after he exposed
discriminatory patterns in faculty hiring and student admissions at Michigan.

Lawsin was a senior lecturer, who was on leave caring for a Down syndrome child
recovering from open heart surgery when she received a layoff notice. She fought
it and is still on staff, but has been barred from teaching.

The lawsuit cites violations of Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act and
the state’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act.

Discrimination cases are among the most difficult to win in these times. In this
interview, Kurashige and Lawsin spoke about their case exclusively to _Emil
Amok’s Takeout_.
