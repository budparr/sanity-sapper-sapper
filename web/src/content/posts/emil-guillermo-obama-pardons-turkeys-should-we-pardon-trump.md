President Obama may not be able to place Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court.
But he’s doing what he can in his final days. Like giving the Presidential Medal
of Freedom to luminaries like Maya Lin, the creator of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.

And of course, he pardoned his last turkey the day before Thanksgiving. Actually
two, Tater and Tot from Iowa. The president said one will have to be
vice-turkey.

Pardon me. But if Obama really wanted to save some turkeys’ lives, he’d talk
about vegetarian options like seitan “birds,” or Tofurkys. An estimated 45
million turkeys will be gobbled up this year.

Not at my house. I’m having round mounds of something that approximates a
carcass. Browned vegetable carcass, yum! At least, no animals were harmed.

That’s something to be thankful about. And a bit more humane than the 2016
presidential campaign, which only threatens half the United States of America.

Still, if Obama can pardon two turkeys, can we muster up the holiday spirit to
pardon the president-elect? Just at dinnertime?

Trump seems to be trying hard to confound everyone with his actions that seem to
confirm that most of his campaign pledges were lies.

The man who inspired cheers of “Lock her up,” now says he’s not going to pursue
a special prosecution of Hillary Clinton for whatever cooked-up charges he put
in people’s minds during the campaign.

I like the result, but what a great liar!

Trump’s choices for his top advisor jobs also seem a bit puzzling.

But what would you expect from the least experienced and least qualified person
ever to be elected president.

Trump’s a beneficiary of the White Republicans’ double standard on affirmative
action.

So I wasn’t surprised to hear Trump pick one of his former critics, South
Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador.

They won’t dare fly the confederate flag at the U.N. now!

**_NIKKI HALEY TO THE U.N.? NOW THAT’S UNCONVENTIONAL_**

Haley’s qualifications? Experience? She’s been on a few trade missions, but
compare Haley with the current ambassador Samantha Power, and it’s embarrassing.
Power, a former journalist and Harvard academic, won a Pulitzer for her book on
genocide. With Power, the U.S. had a tough and deep thinker who understands
global affairs and the philosophy of moral intervention.

Haley is like Trump, learning on the job. An apprentice. So far that’s the Trump
Doctrine.

Haley’s parents are immigrants from India.  Nice, but… her stand on the issues?
She’s a political conservative on climate change, which means she won’t come out
and say humans are responsible for global warming. Don’t expect her to fight for
the Paris agreements.

But think of the common good. Someday, you won’t have to cook your turkey or
Tofurky with a stove.

You’ll be able to cook it quite well in the naturally unnatural open air.

Haley is the first woman and a person of color officially named to the Trump
cabinet. There might have been two Asian American women, with Michelle Rhee, the
former head of the DC public schools, on the shortlist for education secretary.
But Trump has picked billionaire Betsy DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor
from Michigan, who no doubt helped that state turn red.

DeVos is an advocate for school vouchers, where you get money and spend it where
you want. Even private schools and charters. That should make conservatives
happy. But she’s also a big advocate of “Common Core,” which many conservatives
hate. Like most of Trump’s picks, DeVos is rich and white. And again, with no
real experience as an educator, only as an activist. Now she has the keys to the
education kingdom. Her husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune. What’s
next? Funding schools with multi-level marketing sales on all consumables?

Of course, DeVos is not _the_ name people are waiting to see pop up in the
headlines. That would be Mitt Romney, a Trump lambaster, now being considered
for secretary of state.

I don’t know what qualifies Romney in the international stage. Organizing the
Utah Winter Olympics? The man who lost to Obama is white and wealthy with no
diplomatic experience. Indeed, Trump would be showing more diplomacy than Romney
by nominating him.

If it happens, it would be yet another Trump apprentice, learning on the job.

But maybe he’s waiting for Black Friday to make that announcement. Or that day
could be Ben Carson’s day to be named HUD secretary. What does the brain surgeon
know about housing? Yup, he too will be learning on the job.

Last week, I mentioned the appointments of Sen. Jeff Sessions. as attorney
general, and Steve Bannon, as chief strategist.

These men unfortunately are not like the other picks so far. They are extremely
well qualified to lead the dismantling of civil rights in America. That’s a
problem. Big League.

**_WHITE NATIONALISTS COME ALIVE_**

Last weekend, when neo-Nazis were gathering in Washington, you could hear these
exuberant phrases: “Hail Trump, Hail our Victory!”

Some even reported the verbs translated to the German “heil,” as in you know
who.

Not exactly, “Happy Thanksgiving.”

These were the words of Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, and if
you haven’t seen the
[video](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/richard-spencer-speech-npi/508379/)
of his weekend gathering of neo-Nazis, emboldened by Trump, don’t do it on a
full stomach.

You’ll be sickened by his throwback racism, reminiscent of the ’30 and ’40s. And
not just in Europe. In California, white nationalists successfully led a
movement to exclude Filipinos from the U.S. It was sheer white purity. And it’s
all being revived by Spencer, inspired by Trump.

“For us as Europeans, it is only normal again when we are great again,” Spencer
said on the video.

 And it’s clear he’s not an advocate for diversity.

“America was until this generation a white country designed for ourselves and
our posterity,” Spencer said. “It is our creation, it is our inheritance and it
belongs to us.”

Well, unless he thinks of us as being on the same team, I’d say we all better
unite and denounce this guy. Fortunately, when asked in his _New York Times_
editorial board meeting, Trump was pretty direct about Spencer and his group of
white nationalists.

> TRUMP: First of all, I don’t want to energize the group. I’m not looking to
> energize them. I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group…What
> we do want to do is we want to bring the country together, because the country
> is very, very divided, and that’s one thing I did see, big league. It’s very,
> very divided, and I’m going to work very hard to bring the country together.

> ‘Those people are booing,’ and she said, ‘Yup.’ They’d never booed before. But
> now they boo. You know, it was a group and another group was going the

> No, I want to bring the country together. It’s very important to me. We’re in

So you see The Donald has feelings. He knows half of the country despises him.
But he’s new at this. He’s his own apprentice.

Trump can learn a lot from the man he tried to derail on some birther nonsense.

**_GIVING THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA_**

President Obama, after pardoning Tater and Tot today, had his own sentimental
feelings about being the outgoing president. He listed off some impressive
accomplishments: six years of job creation, the longest streak ever. Low
unemployment. Wages rising. Inequality narrowing. Housing market healing. The
stock market tripling.

Think of the dark economic days of 2008. The president has given us a lot to be
thankful for.

Do you have health care when no one would give it to you or your family? Do you
have a house that’s right side up after the mortgage crisis. For many Asian
Americans in California’s hardest-hit housing markets, Obama’s refinancing
programs have helped home owners.

“That’s worth gobbling about,” the president said.

Then he tipped his hat to our country’s great diversity, calling it “the source
of our national strength,” and that “out of many we are one.”

“We are bound not by any one race or religion,” said Obama,”but by the adherence
to a common creed that all of us are created equal. And while accepting our
differences and building a diverse society has never been easy, it has never
been more important.”

The president said, “We have to see ourselves in each other because we all have
families we love.”

After the campaign he ran, it’s hard to see Trump, the former birther, saying
those words.

But let’s hope he learns from Obama.

The president has been the best handcuffed, gridlocked president we’ve ever had.

As we move toward our uncertain future, he’s given us reason to curb momentarily
our political anxieties, and be thankful.

We’ve had the last eight years. We’re going to have to fight to make sure we
keep moving forward.
