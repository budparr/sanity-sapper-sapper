New York, NY — On **Thursday, March 21**, in New York, NY, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will release detailed findings from its exit poll of 4,089 Asian American voters in New York in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results will be released at a special presentation at Dickstein Shapiro LLP, 1633 Broadway, at 12 noon.

In anticipation of Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and the “Gang of 8’s” forthcoming comprehensive immigration reform proposal, AALDEF will detail Asian American support for immigration reform in New York, as well as profiles of the Asian American vote by ethnicity, nativity, party enrollment, age, and English proficiency.

AALDEF conducted the exit poll in New York counties with large Asian American populations, including New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), and Queens Counties. The exit poll results in New York are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/), which reveals vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.

* Vote for President and Congress
* Party enrollment and voting history
