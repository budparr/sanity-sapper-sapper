At this weekend’s dueling rallies over the proposed Islamic cultural center and
mosque near Ground Zero, this much was clear: The opposition to the project is
larger and much better organized. In addition to having at least double the
turnout of supporters, opponents had a stage and soundsystem and proper, printed
signs that conveyed something to people watching on their TV sets, anywhere in
the world.

Now, supporters of the Park51 development are hoping to change that. Tomorrow, a
large coalition of groups and individuals (full list below) is announcing its
formation. It’s called the Coalition of New York Neighbors for American Values,
and it includes the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Manhattan
Young Democrats, Common Cause/New York, CAIR-NY and the New York Civil Liberties
Union.

Separately, Frank Fredericks, who briefly worked as a consultant for the Cordoba
Initiative, and who happens to be a Born Again Christian, has co-founded
Religious Freedom USA, which is organizing its first event on September 12: the
Liberty Walk, which will stop by various religious institutions, including the
site of Park51. Fredericks says the group will help address the fear, as he sees
it, that many Americans have of Muslims, and help understand the place of
Muslims in American society. The group says it expects 1,000 to 2,000 people at
its event, but is asking people to not bring signs — just American flags.
