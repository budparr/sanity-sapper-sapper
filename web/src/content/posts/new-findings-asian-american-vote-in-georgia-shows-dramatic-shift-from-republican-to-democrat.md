February 28, 2013 — Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 361 Asian American voters in Georgia in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that Asian Americans are a growing segment of the electorate in Georgia, with a strong shift from Republican to Democrat in the 2012 elections.

62% of Asian Americans polled in Georgia voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. In 2010, AALDEF’s exit poll found 38% of Asian American voters in Georgia were enrolled in the Republican Party. In 2012, only 21% in Georgia were enrolled in the Republican party. Democratic Party enrollment stayed virtually unchanged, with 32% enrolled in 2010 and 33% enrolled in 2012. The exit poll revealed an increase of independent voters in Georgia, from 30% in 2010 to 42% in 2012. The majority of Asian Americans polled (56%) in Georgia supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.

“Our exit poll results indicate that Asian Americans are an increasingly diverse, growing portion of the Georgia electorate,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of the Democracy Program at AALDEF. “Issues that mattered to Asian Americans in Georgia, including immigration reform, accounted for Republican and independent voters voting for President Obama in the 2012 elections.”

In Georgia, AALDEF conducted the exit poll in cities with large Asian American populations, including Norcross, Doraville, Duluth, and Suwanee. The exit poll results in Georgia are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/).

According to Census data, the Asian American population in Georgia increased 83% over the past decade. The largest Asian ethnic groups in the Georgia exit poll were Asian Indian (33%), Korean (24%), Chinese (14%), Vietnamese (11%), Bangladeshi (5%), Pakistani (4%), and Filipino (3%).

**About the Exit Poll:**

AALDEF’s multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.  AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. In the 2008 Presidential Election, AALDEF surveyed 16,665 Asian American voters in eleven states. More than 100 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize over 800 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans. A list of co-sponsoring organizations and law firms follows below.
