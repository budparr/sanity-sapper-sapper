AALDEF seeks pro bono attorneys to represent eligible people who qualify under
the expanded DACA and the new DAPA programs. Attorneys must attend an AALDEF
training in order to take a case.

The first training will be held on **February 26, 2015** at 6:30 pm, at the
office of **Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson**, One New York Plaza, NYC.

RSVP to <mailto:jlei@aaldef.org>. Light dinner will be provided.A significant
number of Asian immigrants are among an estimated 300,000 additional
undocumented individuals who may benefit from an expansion of the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Although applications were to be
accepted beginning on February 18, 2015, a Texas federal court ruling on Feb. 17
has temporarily halted the President’s executive immigration actions, including
the expanded DACA and new DAPA programs. The Justice Department has announced
that it will appeal this ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

DACA offers temporary relief from the threat of deportation to young people and
allows them to obtain employment authorization. Last November, the Obama
administration announced the expansion of DACA and the creation of a new
deferred action program known as DAPA for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful
permanent residents, which will begin in May 2015. For many, this will be the
first opportunity to legally work and live in this country.No prior legal
experience is required, but pro bono counsel will be required to attend a
training prior to taking a case. These cases would help support the work of
RAISE,  a pan-Asian undocumented youth-led group affiliated with AALDEF.
