On Thursday, September 1, 2016, the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), CUNY
Center for Community and Ethnic Media (CCEM), Asian American Federation (AAF),
MinKwon Center for Community Action, Asian American Legal Defense and Education
Fund (AALDEF), and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (WHIAAPI), which is housed within the Department of Education, will
participate in a media roundtable to discuss Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals (DACA) and its implications for individuals of Asian and Pacific
Islander descent.

Representatives from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and
WHIAAPI will discuss the impact of DACA on AAPI individuals, including those in
the Chinese, Korean, Indian, and Filipino communities.

In 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who
came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request
consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal.
They may also request work authorization. Deferred action is a use of
prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual on a
case-by-case basis for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not
provide lawful status.

According to some estimates, over 130,000 AAPI individuals in the United States
may be eligible to request DACA. Across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, this
could impact approximately 14,000 individuals of Asian and Pacific Islander
descent, yet requests for DACA remain disproportionately low in the AAPI
community.
