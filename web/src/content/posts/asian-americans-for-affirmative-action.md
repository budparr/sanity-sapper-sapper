## The Notion Blog, January 9, 2007

In response to NYT reporter Timothy Egan’s Jan. 7 article, “Little Asia on the Hill,” The Nation’s Richard Kim writes in his blog, The Notion:

“What Egan fails to note here is that, despite the possibility that Asian
Americans may be the group most “disadvantaged” by affirmative action, they
consistently, vigorously and overwhelmingly support it at the polls. Back in
1996, California governor Pete Wilson, Ward Connerly and a host of other
right-wingers ran a vicious, race-wedge campaign for Prop. 209. Asian
communities were targeted with a slew of invidious, “me-first” messages designed
to appeal to their narrow self-interests. And yet, 61% of Asian American voters
rejected Prop. 209. Last year, when Michigan voters approved a similar measure
(Prop. 2) by 58%, [75% of Asian American voters](https://www.imdiversity.com/villages/asian/politics_law/nam_asian_turnout_1106.asp)
voted against it. Joining the NAACP, Rainbow/Push Coalition, the ACLU and the
UAW in mobilizing opposition to Prop. 2 was the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund.”
