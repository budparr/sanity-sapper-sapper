#### A Collaboration with Asian Women’s Christian Association in Teaneck, NJ

Teaneck, NJ—The **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Funds New Jersey Asian American Legal Project (NJ-AALP)**, in partnership with the **Asian Womens Christian Association (AWCA)**, a Korean American non-profit agency in Bergen County, has announced that it will hold a free legal advice clinic on immigration and workers rights for the Korean community on the evening of January 30.

NJ-AALP volunteer attorneys will offer free, confidential legal advice through NJ-AALPs volunteer attorneys on employment and immigration law issues with interpretation availaable in Korean. Over the past two years, NJ-AALP has assisted workers in receiving fair wages and treatment in the restaurant, services, construction, and manufacturing industries.

Said **NJ-AALP Director and AALDEF attorney Alex Saingchin**: "We are very excited to partner with AWCA to host this free legal clinic for the growing Korean American community in New Jersey. Many immigrant workers in the community work long hours, but their employers often do not pay them the wages they are owed. Even if a worker is undocumented or out of status, he or she has the same legal rights to minimum wage and overtime pay. We want to make sure that people who are not sure about their rights can have their questions answered."

Individuals who would like to receive free, confidential legal advice regarding employment or immigration law must contact the AWCA at (201) 862-1665 to secure an appointment for January 30th.

**WHAT:** Free NJ-AALP Workers Rights and Immigration Legal Clinic

**WHEN:** Evening of Wednesday, January 30th (by appointment)

**WHERE:**  
Asian Womens Christian Association (AWCA)  
9 Genesee Avenue Teaneck, NJ 07666

**HOW:** Call AWCA at (201) 862-1665 to schedule an appointment.

NJ-AALP has been working to inform Asian American residents about the following labor protections that apply to all workers:

* The minimum wage in New Jersey is $7.15 an hour, and overtime wages must also be paid for every hour a worker must work beyond 40 hours a week.
* It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against anyone on the basis of their race, religion, gender, national origin, or marital status, and no agency may ask you about your immigration status if you file a complaint against an employer.
  </ul>

NJ-AALP has hosted several clinics in the Asian American community in New Jersey over the past two years. With help from several Asian American community organizations, there has been a tremendous turnout from the community at each of the clinics.
