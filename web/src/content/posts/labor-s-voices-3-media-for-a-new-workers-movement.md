Dear Friends,

Join journalists, authors, educators, and worker activists David Bacon, Tom Zaniello, Elizabeth Fones-Wolf, Lucas Benitez, Stanley Aronowitz, Steve Early, Raj Jayadev, Amanda Cooper, Janine Jackson, Jerry Colby, Rev. Nelson Johnson, Bhairavi Desai, Greg Tarpinian, Tom Robbins, Ana Avendaño and many other international and national media activists at the **Labor’s Voices 3 Conference** in New York City from April 26-28, 2007. 

Labor’s Voices 3: Media for a New Workers’ Movement is an opportunity to explore media’s role in organizing and building a stronger and inclusive workers’ movement; connect disparate constituencies in unions, workers centers, independent media and universities; and develop a national labor media strategy.

In 2000 and 2002, Labor’s Voices conferences 1 and 2 challenged the labor movement to become more relevant to union members and unorganized workers by engaging them through a democratic media. Labor’s Voices 3 will build on this theme.
