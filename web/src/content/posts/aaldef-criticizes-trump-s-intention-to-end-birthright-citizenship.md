Today, Axios released its interview with President Trump, who indicated his plans to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship. 

Margaret Fung, AALDEF executive director, issued the following statement:

"Trump says he wants to end birthright citizenship by signing an executive order. This campaign rhetoric, right before the midterm elections, stirs up anti-immigrant sentiments and is especially offensive to Asian Americans. In 1898, at a time when the racist Chinese Exclusion Act prevented Asian immigration to America, the Supreme Court in _U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark_ ruled that a person born in this country is a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Trump is not above the law, and he should not use his executive authority to violate constitutional guarantees of citizenship."
