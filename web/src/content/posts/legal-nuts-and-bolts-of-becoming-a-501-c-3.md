The Pro Bono Committee of the

**Asian American Bar Association of New York (AABANY)**

in collaboration with the

**Asian American Legal Defense and Education** **Fund** and

**Asian American Arts Alliance**

Presents a free workshop on:

Legal Nuts and Bolts

of Becoming a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit

This workshop is for community leaders to learn more about applying for tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) and incorporating as not-for-profit/nonprofit corporations under New York State law.

Experienced attorneys will outline the benefits and drawbacks in applying for tax-exempt status, overview the application process, and give general descriptions about the obligations of non-incorporated/non-501(c)(3) groups under federal tax and state incorporation laws. It will also explore alternatives such as fiscal sponsorship for fundraising purposes.

NOTE: Attendees are invited to ask general questions from practitioners but this event is not intended to provide individual groups with legal advice. Referrals for attorneys, however, can be provided.
