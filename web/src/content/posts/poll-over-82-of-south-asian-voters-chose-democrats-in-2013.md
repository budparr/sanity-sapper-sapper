According to the results of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund’s (AALDEF) exit poll in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, South Asian American voters voted for Democrat candidates in staggeringly high numbers. In New York, 91% of South Asian American voters favored Democrat Bill de Blasio for mayor, [compared](/press-release/new-poll-asian-american-voters-not-tied-to-political-party-in-key-states/) to 79% of Asian Americans overall. In the close race for governor in Virginia, 85% of South Asian American voters favored Democrat Terry McAuliffe, compared to 71% of Asian Americans overall.

In total, 82% of South Asian American voters voted for Democrat candidates across all three states.  69% of South Asian Americans were enrolled in the Democratic Party, 7% were enrolled in the Republican Party, and 23% were not enrolled in any party. Notably, among Bangladeshi Americans, 86% were enrolled in the Democratic Party. More than one in ten (12%) of South Asian American voters polled were first-time voters.

“The high numbers of first-time South Asian American voters show that the community is increasingly coming to the polls and voting for Democrat candidates at astoundingly high rates,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “In New York, South Asian American voters supported Bill De Blasio at rates comparable to African American voters (95%). The South Asian American community should be recognized as a political force.”

AALDEF conducted a nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 487 South Asian Americans at 24 poll sites after the mayoral election in New York and the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia.

“As the South Asian community continues to grow in New York City, jobs and the economy continue to be the primary issues of concern, which is not surprising as so many are working in the service industries and are self-employed,” said Seema Agnani, Executive Director of Chhaya CDC. “These workers are often the last to feel the effects of economic growth even though much of their work is what drives this City’s resilient economy. As our City continues toward recovery, we will be looking to the new administration to ensure everyone is uplifted and benefits from new investments and strategies.”

The exit poll further indicated that 71% of South Asian Americans supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Moreover, 56% of South Asian American voters polled said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate for Congress who supported comprehensive immigration reform, with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

“Given that South Asians are among the most rapidly growing ethnic groups in the United States, it is not surprising to see so many first-time voters becoming engaged with the political process during the most recent election,” said Deepa Iyer, Executive Director of South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT). “South Asian voters are also becoming increasingly vocal about the need for immigration reform, one of the most pressing issues affecting Asian immigrants today. The results from AALDEF’s exit poll further emphasize the role of South Asians as an important voting bloc, and reinforce the issues they care about and want their elected leaders to address.”
