Last night, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 253 Asian American voters in Pennsylvania in the November 2012 elections. The results indicated that Asian Americans strongly backed Democratic candidates for President and Congress, and the majority supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for undocumented people.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/) in jurisdictions with large Asian American populations. In Pennsylvania, the exit poll was conducted in Philadelphia and Upper Darby.

89% of Asian Americans polled in Pennsylvania voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. Of those surveyed, 68% were enrolled in the Democratic Party, while only 10% were enrolled in the Republican Party. 22% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party.

“Strong support for issues including immigration reform led Asian American voters polled in Philadelphia and Upper Darby to cast the ballot for President Obama and Democratic candidates at some of the highest levels we’ve seen across the nation,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, AALDEF Democracy Program Director.

The major factors influencing the Asian American vote in Pennsylvania were health care (44%), economy/jobs (41%), education (23%), and civil rights/immigrants rights (23%). The majority of Asian Americans (69%) in Pennsylvania supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.

The largest Asian ethnic groups in the Pennsylvania exit poll were Chinese (35%), Vietnamese (24%), Cambodian (12%), and Asian Indian (6%).  More than 1 in 4 (28%) were first-time voters.

AALDEF’s Glenn Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 multilingual exit poll at the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation. [View the presentation >](/uploads/pdf/AALDEF%202012%20Exit%20Poll%20Presentation%20Pennsylvania.pdf)

**About the Exit Poll:**

AALDEF’s multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.  AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. In 2012, more than 100 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize over 800 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans. A list of co-sponsoring organizations and law firms follows below.
