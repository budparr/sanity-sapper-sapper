Politicker NJ -- In a majority black city, other minority groups argued in the name of diversity for greater minority representation in Congress at today's Congressional Redistricting Commission meeting at Rutgers.

Early testimony focused on Bergen County, where two white males: U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman (D-9) and U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett (R-5) divide the spoils at present.

Prospect Park Mayor Mohamed T. Khairullah provided the meeting's first testimony, calling for greater Arab-American and community of interest presence in Congress.

"I ask that this commission ... ensure the federal representation of our voice," said Khairullah.

Jerry Vattamala of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund likewise made his case for his group, mostly arguing emphatically for the alteration of Bergen County - currently split in half - into one congressional district.

"The Asian American vote should not continue to be diluted," Vattamala said. "Asian Americans are severely underrepresented in New Jersey. They should not be divided.

"The 9thÂ congressional district should be expanded northward (to include more Asians)," he added.

The alteration would impact Garrett.

Vattamala also objected to a map that now - in his view - divides Asian in Middlesex (currently served by three congressmen), Bergen and Hudson counties.
