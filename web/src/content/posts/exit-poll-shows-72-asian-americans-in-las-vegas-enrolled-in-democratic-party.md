April 25, 2013 — Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 336 Asian American voters in Las Vegas, Nevada in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that Asian Americans backed President Obama and Democratic candidates by a wide margin, and a staggering 88% supported comprehensive immigration reform.

81% of Asian Americans polled in Las Vegas, Nevada voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. Of those surveyed, 72% were enrolled in the Democratic Party, while only 17% were enrolled in the Republican Party. 10% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party.

“The Asian American growth rate in Nevada is the highest in the nation, at 116%,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, AALDEF Democracy Program Director. “Asian Americans make up close to 10% of the population in Clark County. This is a rapidly gowing population with high Democratic party enrollment, and policymakers should be advised of the issues that are driving these voters to the polls.”

The major factors influencing the Asian American vote in Las Vegas were economy/jobs (63%), health care (40%), education (32%), and civil rights/immigrants rights (25%). 88% supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters][1] in jurisdictions with large Asian American populations. In Las Vegas, the largest Asian ethnic group polled was Filipino Americans at 67%. This was followed by Chinese (6%), Asian Indian (2%), and Korean (2%) Americans.

Glenn Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 multilingual exit poll in a telebriefing on April 25. [View the presentation >][2]
