**The Pro Bono Committee of the Asian American Bar Association of New York
(AABANY)** in collaboration with the **Asian American Legal Defense**
presents a free workshop on: **Legal Nuts and Bolts of Becoming a 501(c)(3)
Nonprofit**

This workshop is for community leaders to learn more about applying for
tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) and incorporating as
not-for-profit/nonprofit corporations under New York State law.

Experienced attorneys will outline the benefits and drawbacks in applying for
tax-exempt status, overview the application process, and give general
descriptions about the obligations of non-incorporated/non-501(c)(3) groups
under federal tax and state incorporation laws. It will also explore
alternatives such as fiscal sponsorship for fundraising purposes.

NOTE: Attendees are invited to ask general questions from practitioners but this
event is not intended to provide individual groups with legal advice. Referrals
for attorneys, however, can be provided.
