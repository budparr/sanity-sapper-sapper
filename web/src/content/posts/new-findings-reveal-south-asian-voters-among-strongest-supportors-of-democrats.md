The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 2,165 South Asian American voters in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that South Asian Americans showed strong support for comprehensive immigration reform and the Democratic Party candidates for President and Congress.

“Among Asian Americans, South Asian American voters showed the strongest support for President Obama as well as the highest enrollment in the Democratic party,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “Overwhelming support for immigration reform was a contributing factor to the strong Democratic turnout in 2012.”

South Asian American voters showed among the strongest support for President Obama, with 96% of Bangladeshi, 91% of Pakistani, and 84% of Asian Indian American voters surveyed voting for President Obama, compared to 77% of Asian Americans surveyed nationally. Enrollment in the Democratic Party was also higher across South Asian ethnicities. 84% of Indo-Caribbean, 79% of Bangladeshi, 73% of Pakistani, and 65% of Asian Indian American voters were enrolled in the Democratic Party, compared to 57% of all Asian Americans surveyed nationally.

The majority of South Asian Americans supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship, with the highest support among Bangladeshi (78%), Pakistani (78%), Indo-Caribbean (77%), and Asian Indian (64%) American voters.

AALDEF, a 39-year old New York-based national organization, conducted the surveys as part of a [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/). The largest South Asian ethnic groups in the exit poll were Asian Indian (45%), Bangladeshi (40%), Pakistani (10%), and Indo-Caribbean (5%).

Glenn Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 multilingual exit poll at the National South Asian Summit, hosted by South Asian Americans Leading Together and the South Asian Law Students Association at American University Washington College of Law.
