On June 5, 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) opened a third notice and comment period for its proposed rule changes affecting the fee waiver application process. These proposed changes would discourage immigrants from filing for fee waivers and immigration benefits and would limit access to naturalization for eligible legal residents. Currently, immigrants seeking to naturalize must  pay $640 plus an $85  
biometric fee, for a total of $725.per applicant.
