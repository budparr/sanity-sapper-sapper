On July 25, a three-judge federal panel heard oral arguments in _United States v. City of Boston_ regarding the transliteration of candidate names in Chinese on ballots, so that limited English proficient Chinese American voters can vote for their candidates of choice. AALDEF, Greater Boston Legal Services, and co-counsel Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP filed an _amicus_ brief on behalf of Chinese American voters and organizations to the court in support of fully translated ballots.
