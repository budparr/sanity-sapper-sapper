New York –This Saturday, July 26, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will be conducting legal rights information outreach in four neighborhoods with large Asian American populations: Bensonhurst and Kensington, Brooklyn; Jackson Heights, Queens; and Jersey City, NJ. AALDEF staff attorneys, student interns and volunteers will also be conducting nonpartisan voter registration, focusing on the growing numbers of new citizens who are eligible to vote for the first time in the 2008 elections.

“We want Asian Americans to learn about their legal rights, use the legal system, and get involved in the political process,” said AALDEF executive director Margaret Fung.

At this multi-site summer outreach event, AALDEF will be distributing “know your rights” materials in several Asian languages about a wide variety of topics: workers’ rights to a minimum wage and overtime pay, combating hate violence in public schools, and services for trafficking survivors.

Each neighborhood site will be staffed by AALDEF attorneys and volunteers speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, and Gujarati and distributing additional materials in Bangla and Tagalog.
