In past elections, Asian Americans have faced a series of barriers in exercising their right to vote, including segregated “Asian” voting lines. When the news media reported on election results, Asian Americans were often overlooked. In response, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) has conducted a non-partisan exit poll of Asian American voters to document Asian American voting patterns and document instances of anti-Asian voter disenfranchisement. AALDEF has monitored the elections for compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act, which mandates bilingual ballots and forbids anti-Asian voter discrimination. In the 2012 elections, 850 volunteers polled 9,096 Asian American voters in 14 states and Washington, DC.

We are recruiting volunteers in the following states to work in 3-hour shifts on Election Day: California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, DC.

There will be a one-hour training session for all volunteers in October (90 minutes for CLE credits). All AALDEF volunteers must be non-partisan during the time they are at polling places on Election Day. Please complete the form at [www.aaldef.net](https://www.aaldef.net) and join us in protecting voting rights. Thank you!
