On June 13, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) submitted to Congress a comprehensive report on the Voting Rights Act, in which it finds that voters continue to face pervasive racial discrimination, harassment, and institutional barriers in the electoral process.

AALDEFs report, **Asian Americans and the Voting Rights Act: The Case for Reauthorization**, found that disenfranchisement persists and that the Acts expiring provisions require immediate renewal. The sharply focused study covered tens of thousands of voters and investigated compliance with Congressional reforms in the face of centuries-old policies of anti-Asian exclusion and ongoing discrimination.
