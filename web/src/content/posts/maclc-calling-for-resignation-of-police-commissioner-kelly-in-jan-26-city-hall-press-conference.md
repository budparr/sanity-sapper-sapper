**Muslim Groups Call for Resignation of Police Commissioner Kelly**

_Demand City Council Institute Community Control & Oversight Mechanism Over the
NYPD_

January 25, 2012 (New York, NY) — In the wake of revelations about NYPD’s
involvement in production of an anti-Muslim propaganda film, the Muslim American
Civil Liberties Coalition (MACLC), Islamic Center of North America (ICNA) NY,
and Majlis Ash Shura call for the resignation of Police Commissioner Raymond
Kelly and the Deputy Commissioner of Public Affairs Paul Browne. Kelly’s and
Browne’s admission of their involvement in the production of _The Third Jihad_
marks the blatant bigotry and lack of transparency that permeates the NYPD’s
approach to New York’s Muslim communities. MACLC, ICNA NY, and Majlis Ash Shura
demand that the City Council institute an independent community control and
oversight mechanism for the NYPD. MACLC further calls on the NYPD to retrain all
1500 officers who watched _The Third Jihad_ during cadet training.

In early 2011, MACLC contacted the NYPD regarding the use of the _The Third
Jihad_ in cadet training, only to have the NYPD deny its role in training of
cadets. However, police documents obtained by a Freedom of Information Law
(FOIL) request now reveal that the film was shown to nearly 1500 officers during
police training. Only after the film’s producer identified for the _New York
Times _the date on which Kelly was interviewed for the film, did Kelly and
Browne admit to participation in the film.

Taken in context of the Associated Press’s reporting about the NYPD’s extensive
surveillance programs–which literally map Muslim communities, and all aspects of
Muslim life in New York City–it is now clear that the NYPD’s dealings with New
York’s diverse Muslim communities are based on bigotry and blanket suspicion.

“NYPD officials should not have permitted and actively participated in the
screening and creation of such hateful propaganda produced by a special interest
organization,” said Nermeen Arastu, staff attorney at the Asian American Legal
Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), a member of MACLC. “The NYPD must retrain
all 1500 officers who watched _The Third Jihad_ during cadet training. The NYPD
treats all Muslim communities in this city as suspicious. It is imperative for
the City Council to institute an oversight mechanism over the NYPD.”

Shown to NYPD officers, _The Third Jihad _portrays Muslims as engaged in a “1400
year war” to “infiltrate and dominate America.” The film includes inflammatory
imagery, including people who appear to be Muslim engaging in acts of terrorism,
car bombs exploding, executed children, and repeated images of an Islamic flag
flying over the White House. Elected officials and a coalition of interfaith
voices have vehemently denounced its use. MACLC has sent several letters
requesting a prompt investigation into how such materials came to be widely
disseminated in trainings and demanded transparency on the existing
counter-terrorism training materials in use. The NYPD has not meaningfully
responded. While the NYPD claims to have discontinued use of the film, a
spokesperson told the _New York Times_ that it has no plans to correct false
impressions set by it.

The film was produced by The Clarion Fund, an anti-Muslim nonprofit
organization, which produced a similar 2008 video entitled _Obsession: Radical
Islam’s War Against the West_ that it distributed through swing states in the
last presidential election. The Clarion Fund currently counts among its
supporters Sheldon Adelson, who donated millions to a super PAC that backs Newt
Gingrich.

“Under Kelly’s watch, the NYPD has developed an approach to policing
counterterrorism that seems to start from a place of suspicion for New Yorkers
with any identifying Muslim characteristics,” said Amna Akbar, Supervising
Attorney at the CLEAR program (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &
Responsibility), and Adjunct Professor at CUNY School of Law. “It is unethical
and illegal for the NYPD to conflate religion, race, and national origin with
suspicion for terrorism. The NYPD needs to make some serious changes to its
divisive and troubled approach to Muslim communities.”

MACLC, ICNA NY, and Majlis Ash Shura call for the resignation of Kelly and
Browne; for the City Council to investigate the matter and to institute an
effective and meaningful community control and oversight mechanism; and for the
retraining of all cadets who watched _The Third Jihad_.

“As an organization that builds relationships between New York’s diverse
religious communities and civic institutions, we are deeply disturbed by the
NYPD’s breach of trust with the diverse communities it serves. ICNY calls on the
NYPD to pursue it goals of ‘Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect’ through
steps toward greater transparency and unbiased education for its officers,” said
Reverend Chloe Breyer, Executive Director of the Interfaith Center of New York.

“When I raised the issue at the pre-Ramadan briefing,” said Imam Al Hajj Talib
Abdur-Rashid, President of the Islamic Leadership Council of Metropolitan New
York, “Kelly denied use of the film as a training tool, and stated clearly and
unequivocally that it was only ‘playing in the background’ of a particular
session before it began.” Abdur-Rashid added the NYPD has demonstrated “cultural
incompetence” and “intentional deception,” citing its use of the film as part of
a mindset responsible for violation of the civil liberties of Muslims.

MACLC is a New York-based coalition of citizens, community and faith leaders,
organizers, advocates, attorneys, and organizations. MACLC aims to give voice to
absent perspectives on issues of national security, counterterrorism, law
enforcement, and civil rights, especially as they impact Muslim communities in
post-9/11 New York City.
