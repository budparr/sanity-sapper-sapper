Just when you thought it was bad enough he upset Filipinos worldwide–including
the 4 million Asian Americans of Filipino descent in the U.S.–Donald Trump
couldn’t leave well enough alone.

Or maybe to erase the memory of denigrating all Filipinos as terrorists in a
previous news cycle, Trump felt he had to come up with a brand new inanity.

What else could he do but hurl another Hillary slur?

If you haven’t heard, Trump thinks a veiled threat of assassination is just fun
and games in the realm of politics.

But like kidding with a TSA screener about how you’re carrying a big bomb
between your legs, it’s best not done.

Especially if you want to set a good example as the potential leader of the free
world.

Trump continues to give us a preview of what the political horror show known as
a Trump presidency might look like. Instead of inspiring confidence, he’s
letting us know that one of his chief attributes is his alarming recklessness.

It came up during a stump speech in North Carolina on Tuesday, when he
speculated about how to stop Hillary Clinton from making a SCOTUS appointment
who would be tough on gun laws.

“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Trump said,
according to a report in _The New York Times_. “Although the Second Amendment
people–maybe there is, I don’t know.”

We all know Trump wasn’t really thinking about someone doing extensive lobbying,
or anything like that.

Giving him the benefit of the doubt, Trump’s statement was what you might call a
“double-gun-tendre.”

Why talk specifically about the NRA or something real (like the coincidental
major donation he just got from the NRA) when he can be ambiguous and have it
both ways. Trump dominates the news and keeps people guessing. He drives his
loving anti-Clinton base wild, but his critics wilder.

And it leaves the rest of us wondering if he has what it takes to lead our
country.

For someone who wants his name to exude elite luxury, Trump’s political brand
has come to be known as base, coarse, and covered in mud.

In a word, ugly.

The Trump gun comments about Clinton came after last week’s stunning remarks,
when Trump warned that immigrants, including those from the Philippines,
represent a pool of recruitment for Islamist terror groups and should be vetted
heavily before allowed into the U.S.

It provoked one Philippine legislator to propose that Trump be permanently
banned from entering the Philippines.

According to a Philippine law dating back to 2001, the country’s Bureau of
Immigration and Deportation can exclude or deny entry to the country anyone who
has shown disrespect to the Filipino people.

Congressman Jose Salceda’s Resolution 143 criticized Trump and said The Donald
should be “banned for being inimical” to the Philippines’ “national interest.”

Said Salceda in his resolution: “There is no feasible interest or reasonable
justification to the wholesale labeling of Filipinos as coming from a terrorist
state.”

Salceda said the remarks have “aggravated the shame” on Filipinos, Filipino
Muslims, including Filipino migrants and overseas workers.

Salceda called Trump’s remarks “unprompted and undeserved,” typical of the
“unrepentantly negative, dysfunctionally nativist, aggressively adversarial
attitude towards immigrants in the USA where he aspires to be the leader, and
thus could be in position to influence policies affecting” the second largest
group of Asian Americans in the U.S.

Add to that the long history of the Philippines as a former colony and as a
small but important ally during the Gulf War, and Trump’s harsh comments sound
downright ignorant.

But Trump just doesn’t seem to care. And why should he care about anything, so
long as the money flow to him doesn’t stop.

Trump’s already building his brand in the Philippines and has licensed his name
to a new Trump Tower in the Makati business section of Manila. The property is
more than 94 percent pre-sold.

It’s hard to imagine how Filipinos would take to living in a high-rise building
named after such a newly tagged low-rise villain.

Then again, the country is currently rehabbing the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos, who raped and pillaged the Philippines far worse than candidate Trump.

But at least Marcos was Filipino.

Trump would have to show up at a Filipino barrio fiesta like the one in
Stockton, Calif. this month, dressed in one of those see-through-shirts (barong
tagalog) and subjecting his ankles to the bamboo pole dance (the tinikling) with
his yellow-orange hair flopping all around.

Even then, for most Filipinos, that still wouldn’t be penance enough for the
inflammatory comments he’s made.
