The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) has joined an
_amicus_ brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold aggregate contribution
limits in the lawsuit _McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (FEC)_.

Under existing campaign finance laws, there is a $2,600 limit on donations by an
individual to a single candidate, party organization or political action
committee, and a $123,200 aggregate limit on donations by a single individual to
all federal candidates and committees in a single election cycle. The lawsuit
challenges the aggregate limit.

AALDEFâ€™s _amicus_ brief, authored by legal counsel at the Campaign Legal Center,
contends that without the aggregate cap, a single wealthy donor could funnel
more than $3.6 million to federal candidates and parties in just one election
cycle, and millions more through donations to political action committees.
Contributions of this size would enable domination of elections by a few
individuals to the detriment of our democratic process. The aggregate
contribution limits are therefore necessary to prevent corruption in the form of
wealthy donors having undue influence over elected officials.

The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in _McCutcheon v. FEC_ for Oct.
8, 2013.

Groups joining in the brief include AALDEF, Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause,
AARP, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics
in Washington, the League of Women Voters of the United States, Progressives
United and Public Campaign.
