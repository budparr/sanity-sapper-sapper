AALDEF joined 54 other organizations in an open letter to Rep. Peter King (R-NY), chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, criticizing the upcoming March 10 hearings on _The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community_.  

“By singling out one particular religious group for investigation, the hearings unfairly scapegoat an entire community and question the patriotism of millions of American Muslims,” said AALDEF Executive Director Margaret Fung. 

The letter contends that the hearings “will only add to this toxic climate of suspicion toward American Muslims and may hinder the important efforts to maintain trust and mutual respect between American Muslims, law enforcement, and public officials.” A copy of the letter can be read [here][1].
