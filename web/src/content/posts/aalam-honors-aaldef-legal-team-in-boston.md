The Asian American Lawyers Association of Massachusetts (AALAM) honored AALDEF attorney Glenn D. Magpantay and co-counsel with its 2006 Community Service Award for its work ensure Boston’s compliance with the Voting Rigts Act. Accepting the award at ALAAM’s April 6 banquet at Boston’s Langham Hotel were Magpantay, Christopher R. Mirick of Weil Gotshal and Manges LLP (on behalf of honoree Andrew M. Troop), and Cynthia Mark of Greater Boston Legal Services. Their advocacy efforts with the U.S. Department of Justice elections on behalf of Asian American and Latino plaintiff-intervenors led to the City of Boston’s first translated ballots in the 2005 elections.
