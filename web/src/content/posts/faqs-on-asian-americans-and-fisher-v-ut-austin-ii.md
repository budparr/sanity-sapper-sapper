On Nov. 2, 2015, AALDEF filed an [_amicus_ brief](/uploads/pdf/AALDEFfisher2Amicus.pdf) in the U.S. Supreme Court in _Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin_ II, in support of UTâ€™s race-conscious admissions program. Our co-amici included two Asian American groups at UT-Austin: the Asian Desi Pacific Islander Collective and the Asian/Asian American Faculty and Staff Association. [Eighteen other groups](/uploads/pdf/AALDEFfisher2AmiciList.pdf) engaged in education and youth rights issues joined our brief, together with [44 individuals](/uploads/pdf/AALDEFfisher2AmiciList.pdf), including higher education officials and professors of law, education, and Asian American studies.
