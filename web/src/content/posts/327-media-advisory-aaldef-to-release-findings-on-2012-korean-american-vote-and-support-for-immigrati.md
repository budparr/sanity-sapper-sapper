March 25, 2013 — On Wednesday, March 27, in Annandale, VA, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will release detailed findings from its exit poll of 998 Korean American voters in the November 2012 Presidential Elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation.  The results will be released at a special presentation with the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium (NAKASEC) at Yejin Korean Community Service Center in Annandale, VA at 6pm.

AALDEF, a 39-year old New York-based national organization, [polled Asian American voters in 37 cities across 14 states](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/) on Election Day:  New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Michigan, Illinois, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, and Washington, D.C. Korean American voters were one of the largest ethnic groups polled, comprising 11% of the surveys. AALDEF’s exit poll reveals vital information about Korean American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.

AALDEF also [monitored poll sites for barriers](/press-release/asian-americans-report-voting-barriers-and-discrimination-at-poll-sites-across-usa/) to the Korean American vote. One extreme incident occurred in Annandale, VA, where poll workers separated all Korean American voters into segregated lines because “there were so many,” allowing white voters to vote first. Elderly Korean American voters with limited English-proficiency were particularly uncomfortable with the discriminatory treatment.

AALDEF Democracy Program Director Glenn Magpantay will present comparative information on the following topics covered in the 2012 exit poll, including:

* Vote for President and Congress
* Party enrollment and voting history
* Concerns about key issues such as comprehensive immigration reform
* Ethnicity and national origin
* English proficiency levels
* Citizenship tenure (duration)
* First-time voters
* Voting barriers
