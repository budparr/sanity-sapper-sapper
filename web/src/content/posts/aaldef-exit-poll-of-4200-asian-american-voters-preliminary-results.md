**AALDEF EXIT POLL OF 4,200 ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS SHOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS**

New York…Asian American voters in 11 states and Washington DC largely supported Democratic candidates in the 2014 midterm elections, according to preliminary results of an exit poll released today by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF). The multilingual exit poll of over 4,200 Asian American voters was conducted by AALDEF in collaboration with 65 national and local community groups, the largest survey of its kind in the nation.

AALDEF Executive Director Margaret Fung said, “Asian American voters continued to support Democratic candidates in 2014, but their support has declined since the 2012 presidential election. Given the Republican control of Congress and several state houses, the Asian American community–with its large numbers of voters not enrolled in any party–will be able to assess which candidates and political parties best address their concerns over the next few years.”

The 2014 AALDEF Asian American Exit Poll provides a unique snapshot of the voting patterns of Asian Americans in 11 states with large or fast-growing Asian American populations: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Michigan, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, and Washington, DC.  AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. In the 2012 presidential election, AALDEF [polled](https://aaldef.netlify.com/uploads/pdf/Asian%20American%20Vote%202012.pdf) 9,096 Asian American voters in 14 states.
