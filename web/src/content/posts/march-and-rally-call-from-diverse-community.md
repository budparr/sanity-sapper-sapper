**October 21st Demands**

 1. Legalization Now. No half measures, no half-statuses, no guestworkers. Create more opportunities for current and future immigrants to enter and stay. Support fair policies that allow people to live in peace in their home countries.
 2. Keep Families Together. Stop detaining and deporting the parents of US citizens, US veterans, and our community members. Clear immigration backlogs. Pass laws that acknowledge and protect ALL families as we define them.
 3. Due Process and Civil Rights for All. End all detentions and deportations. Repeal mandatory detention and deportation. Give immigrants a fair day in court, in front of fair judges, with fair laws.
 4. Equal Rights for All Workers. Repeal employer sanctions that lower wages for immigrants and low-income workers by making work illegal. Stop hurting workers, street vendors, and small, immigrant businesses through raids, penalties and restrictions on licensing. Grant equal pay for equal work and stop dividing citizen and immigrant workers by selling their work to the lowest bidder.
 5. Defend Minority Voters Right to Vote. Stop all forms of disenfranchisement. Laws requiring birth certificates and proof of citizenship create unfair barriers to voting for all of our communities. Create fair and accessible laws for all of our communities to vote.
 6. No More Discriminatory Immigration Policies. Stop all forms of selective enforcement. Stop targeting Black, LGBT, Muslim and HIV+ immigrants. Protect all of our civil rights.
 7. Stop Profiting from Immigrants Suffering. Stop abusing and exploiting immigrant and citizen workers. Stop the profiteering from jails and detention centers.
 8. Create Community Safety. Stop creating a climate of terror and fear by using local and state officials to enforce immigration laws in schools, the DMV, Department of Corrections, etc.
 9. No More Deaths at the Border. No walls, No killing, No abusing families crossing the border or starving families once they cross.
10. Everyone Must Take a Stand. No more silence. Our religious leaders, our teachers, our neighbors, our unions must all stand up and fight with us. Make NYC a sanctuary for immigrants.
