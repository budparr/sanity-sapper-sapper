On _[Emil Amok’s Takeout](https://bit.ly/2rKNxTk)_, I corner Randall Park at the
gala dinner of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies
(APAICS). a/k/a Asian Prom.

Listen to my short [conversation](https://bit.ly/2rKNxTk) with the “Fresh Off the
Boat” star, as well as an excerpt from his speech accepting the 2017 APAICS
Vision Award.

Oddly, I forgot to ask him if politics was in the cards for him. Writing and
producing was. But politics? He does play a governor in HBO’s “Veep.”

As I flew into D.C., I noticed at the airport magazine racks the conservative
_National Review_ trying to make the case for a presidential bid by “The Rock”–a
Republican.

President Rock?

Dwayne Johnson hosted the season finale of “Saturday Night Live” this past
weekend, and was joined by Tom Hanks.

Hanks said if they ran as a ticket, he’d “get them the senior vote because he
fought in WWII–in ten different movies.

The Rock added that he’d get the minority vote, “because everyone just assumes,
I’m, well, whatever they are.”

It got a big laugh.

It sounds like a joke, but given the rise of a reality show star to the
presidency and the immense popularity of Johnson and Hanks, you never know.

And with that, the SNL banners unfurled to reveal the slogan “Johnson Hanks
2020.”

Considering that The Rock and Hanks seem like stable personalities with decent
vocabularies, anything would be an improvement over the present White House
occupant.

All that, plus the places I spoke and what I encountered, and “Fresh Off the
Boat” star Randall Park, on this week’s [podcast](https://bit.ly/2rKNxTk), _Emil
Amok’s Takeout_.
