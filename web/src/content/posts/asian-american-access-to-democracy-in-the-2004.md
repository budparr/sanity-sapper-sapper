This data-rich report reviews observations from monitoring the 2004 Presidential Elections on November 2, 2004 in twenty-three cities in eight states. Over 1,200 volunteer attorneys, law students, and community volunteers monitored almost 200 poll sites and surveyed nearly 11,000 Asian American voters, in 23 Asian languages and dialects, at 80 poll sites. 

AALDEF observed first-hand a number of problems and also received complaints from Asian American voters, interpreters, and other poll workers.
