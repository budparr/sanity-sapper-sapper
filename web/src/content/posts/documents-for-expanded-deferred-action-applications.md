**Useful Documents To Prepare for Expanded Deferred Action Applications**

On November 20 and 21, 2014, President Obama announced taking executive actions
for immigration relief. These actions include the expansion of Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and a new Deferred Action for Parental
Accountability (DAPA) program, which provides eligible immigrants who have U.S.
citizen or permanent resident sons and daughters temporary relief from
deportation and allows them to apply for work authorization. (For more
information, see our [FAQs on DAPA and Expanded
DACA](/press-release/new-faqs-for-expanded-daca-applications---feb-18/)).
However, as with the original DACA program, these initiatives do not provide a
path to permanent resident (“green card”) status or citizenship.

While we wait for detailed guidance on the process for applying for deferred
action under these two programs, using the DACA criteria as a template of what
to expect, it is important to start collecting documents that you will need in
order to apply. We believe that the following list of documents, which can be
used to prove identity, presence and continuous residence in the United States,
and family ties to U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, will be useful
for preparing applications.

* Passport from your country of origin
