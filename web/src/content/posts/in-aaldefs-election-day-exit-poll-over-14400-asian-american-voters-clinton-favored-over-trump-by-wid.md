New York City…Preliminary AALDEF exit poll findings of close to 14,000 Asian
Americans on Election Day reveal that voters in the swing states of
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, and Nevada strongly favored Hillary Clinton
over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race.

“The extreme anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and racist rhetoric in this election
was deeply disturbing to Asian American voters, who wanted to support candidates
who shared their values and hope for America,” said Margaret Fung, AALDEF
executive director.

AALDEF dispatched 950 attorneys, law students, and community volunteers to 64
cities in 14 states to document voter problems on Election Day and to conduct a
nonpartisan Asian American exit poll in English and 11 Asian languages.

AALDEF Democracy Program Director Jerry Vattamala said: “The Asian American Exit
Poll provides critical information about the Asian American electorate,
including limited English proficiency rates, lack of language assistance, and
other barriers, such as voters being required to prove their citizenship, remove
their religious headscarves, or provide ID because of their race or appearance.”

Based on Asian American voters polled on Election Day, 79% backed Hillary
Clinton, 17% were for Donald Trump, and 3% voted for other candidates. The
following is a breakdown by state:

On Election Day, AALDEF collected surveys from close to 14,000 Asian American
voters at 91 polling places in 14 states with large or fast-growing Asian
American populations. Poll sites were selected based on voter registration
files, census data, interviews with local election officials and community
leaders, and a history of voting problems. Approximately 950 attorneys, law
students, and community volunteers were stationed at poll sites throughout the
day, generally between 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. Surveys were written in English and
11 Asian languages, and volunteers were conversant in Asian languages and
dialects. Additional exit poll results regarding Asian ethnic groups, most
important issues influencing their votes, and preferences for Senate and House
candidates will be released soon.
