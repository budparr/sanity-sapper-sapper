#### Findings Illuminate Filipino American Voting Patterns, Party Enrollment, Voter Priorities for 2008 Elections, and Voting Barriers

New York, NY—Today the **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF)** released detailed findings from its multilingual exit poll of hundreds of Filipino American voters during the November 2006 midterm elections. AALDEF, a 33-year-old civil rights organization, polled more than 4,700 Asian American voters in 23 cities and in nine states on Election Day nationwide. AALDEF surveyed a total of 308 Filipino American voters in nine states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

Said AALDEF Staff Attorney **Glenn Magpantay**, "Filipino Americans are a growing segment of the electorate. During the mid-term elections, Filipino American voters made their voices heard in key U.S. Senate races, expressed strong opinions about priorities for the 2008 elections, and held strong opinions about family reunification and allowing the undocumented to legalize their status in immigration reform policy."

“AALDEF’s findings on the Filipino American electorate tracks well with what we have learned on the field,” says **Gloria T. Caoile**, Co-Chair of the **National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA) FilVote program**. “The exit polls show correlations to length of stay, education, and civic participation. Filipino Americans set roots, become citizens and vote. It’s their belief in America ‘s future that drives them to the polls.”

Said **Perry Diaz**, Co-Chair of NaFFAA FilVote, “Political awareness is the key ingredient to empowerment. I believe that the Filipino-American community has the numbers to make a difference in the American electoral process. FilVote’s role is to make political awareness a priority because only through education can we bring our community to a consciousness that ‘the power of the vote’ drives real economic progress and eventually political empowerment.”

**The Filipino American Vote in the 2006 Midterm Elections**

On Election Day, November 7, 2006, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), with the help of several co-sponsoring organizations and more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers, conducted a nonpartisan, multilingual exit poll of over 4,700 Asian American voters. The questionnaire was available in English and nine Asian languages. Voters were surveyed in 23 cities across nine statesNew York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, Washingtonas well as Washington, D.C.

As part of this effort, AALDEF surveyed a total of 308 Filipino American voters. Highlights of the findings include:

One out of five (22%) respondents had no formal U.S. education, and 10% were first-time voters. Ten percent (10%) of respondents expressed that they were limited English proficient, and 16% identified English as their native language.

**A majority of Filipino Americans voted for Democratic candidates.**

Nearly three out of four (74%) Filipino Americans voted for the Democratic candidate in their states top-ballot race. Twenty-four percent (24%) voted for the Republican candidate, and 2% voted for other candidates.

**Most Filipino Americans were registered Democrats.**

Over half (51%) of Filipino American respondents were registered Democrats, while 22% were registered Republicans, and nearly a quarter (24%) were not enrolled in any political party.

**Economy/Jobs was the most important issue Filipino Americans identified for 2008 presidential candidates to address.**

**Many Filipino Americans have been affected by anti-immigrant sentiment.**

**Filipino American voters encountered unlawful ID requirements.**

Nearly 11,000 Asian American voters in eight states and 3,000 in four states were surveyed in the 2004 and 2002 exit polls, respectively. More than 30 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans.
