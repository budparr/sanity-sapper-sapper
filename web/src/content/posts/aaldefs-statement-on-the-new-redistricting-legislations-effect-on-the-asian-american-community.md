![Map Sen.JPG](/uploads/Map%20Sen.JPG)Late last night, Governor Cuomo signed into law new redistricting lines for State Senate and State Assembly (A9525 / S6696). The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) has been advocating for a redistricting proposal that protects the voting rights of Asian Americans and other communities of color. Together with LatinoJustice PRLDEF, National Institute for Latino Policy (NILP), and the Center for Law and Social Justice (CLSJ) of Medgar Evers College, AALDEF released the [Unity Map][1], a proposed redistricting plan for New York City.

“AALDEF and its Unity Map partners proposed four Asian American majority State Assembly districts and one Asian American majority State Senate district centered in Flushing,” said Jerry Vattamala, staff attorney with AALDEF’s Democracy Project. “Through AALDEF’s advocacy and work within numerous coalitions, we were able to secure three Asian American majority State Assembly districts and an Asian American majority State Senate district in Flushing.”

Despite the fact that the New York State Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment’s (LATFOR) initially proposed State Senate lines ([released in January][2]) received widespread criticism, very few New York City districts were changed between the original proposal and the signed legislation. 

However, one of the only amended districts was the Asian American majority district, Senate District (SD) 16. In February, AALDEF submitted adjustments to LATFOR contending that SD 16 should be more community-defined and compact by including Flushing, Elmhurst, and Bayside, and excluding Bay Terrace. 

“It appears that LATFOR adopted almost all of our adjustments to improve the district,” said Vattamala. “SD 16 is now almost 54% Asian American, whereas before it was 52% Asian American. By adopting our adjustments, LATFOR has brought SD 16 closer to the Asian American majority district proposed in our Unity Map.”

Nonetheless, Vattamala noted that numerous problems in the initial State Senate plan were carried over to the legislation, such as continuing divisions between communities in Sunset Park and Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, which AALDEF also criticized in its statement to LATFOR. 

The new State Assembly legislation follows the Unity Map’s Asian American majority districts in Flushing (Assembly District 40), Flushing/Bayside (AD 25), and Sunset Park/Bensonhurst (AD 49), increasing the Asian American majority districts from one (under the current map) to three. The legislation also unites the community of Bensonhurst (AD 47). 

As with the State Senate legislation, few changes had been made to LATFOR’s original State Assembly plan. Despite adjustments submitted by AALDEF, the Richmond Hill/South Ozone Park community continues to remain divided among numerous State Assembly districts.
