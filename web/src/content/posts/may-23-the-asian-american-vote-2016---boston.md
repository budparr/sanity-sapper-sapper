During the 2016 Presidential Elections, 13,846 Asian American voters
participated in the nation’s largest nonpartisan multilingual exit poll.
AALDEF’s Asian American Exit Poll was conducted in 11 Asian languages and
English in 55 cities across 14 states – NY, NJ, MA, PA, VA, MD, MI, GA, LA, FL,
TX, NV, NM, and CA – and Washington, DC. The exit poll reveals vital information
about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream
voter surveys.

At this special presentation, learn about the Asian American vote in the
Presidential and Congressional elections and opinions on key issues by
ethnicity, nativity, party enrollment, age, and English proficiency. We will
present national data, as well as special data on Massachusetts.
