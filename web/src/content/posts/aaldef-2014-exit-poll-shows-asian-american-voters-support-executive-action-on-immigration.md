New York…Asian American voters in 11 states strongly supported executive action on immigration reform (65%) and favored Democratic candidates in the 2014 midterm elections in eight states, according to updated results of an exit poll by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF). The multilingual exit poll of over 4,100 Asian American voters was conducted by AALDEF in collaboration with 65 national and local community groups, the largest survey of its kind in the nation.

Asian Americans said that the top issues influencing their votes for Congress were Economy/Jobs (50%); Health Care (34%); Education (32%); and Immigration (19%).

In response to the question “If Congress does not act on immigration reform, do you think President Obama should take his own executive actions on immigration?” 65% of Asian Americans polled said yes.

AALDEF Executive Director Margaret Fung said, “Asian American voters, including those not enrolled in a political party, continued to support Democratic candidates in 2014, although this support has declined since the 2012 elections. As to immigration policy, two out of three Asian Americans want President Obama to take executive action on immigration.”

The 2014 AALDEF Asian American Exit Poll provides a unique snapshot of the voting patterns of Asian Americans in 11 states with large or fast-growing Asian American populations: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Michigan, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, and Washington, DC. It was conducted at 63 poll sites in 12 languages: Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Khmer, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, and English.
