Starting on July 30, 2007, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will increase its filing fees for applications, petitions, benefits, and services. Applying for citizenship now costs a total of $400; however, the total fee will become $675 by the end of July. This new total breaks down to $595 for the N-400 Application for Naturalization and $80 for fingerprints (biometric). Replacing or renewing a green card used to prove your lawful permanent residency will cost a total of $370 – this includes $290 for filing Form I-90 and $80 for fingerprints.

Anyone who wants to become a United States citizen: must be at least 18 years old; be a lawful permanent resident (green card holder); have a residence in the United States for 5 years; be physically present in the United States for at least 2 ½ years; have good moral character; speak and write English; and pass a test about United States history, government, and civics. If your spouse is a U.S. citizen, you need 3 years of residency and 1½ years of physical presence in the United States before applying for naturalization.

When applying for citizenship, you should check the date when your green card expires. If you apply for citizenship at least 6 months before your green card expires, you do not pay the fee to renew your green card. It can take more than 6 months to become naturalized. Meanwhile your green card may have expired. USCIS will require you to renew your green card while applying for citizenship if your green card expires within 6 months. As of July 30, you must pay $370 for the green card renewal and $675 for citizenship. Unless you apply at least 6 months in advance of your green card expiring, you will pay total fees of $1045.
