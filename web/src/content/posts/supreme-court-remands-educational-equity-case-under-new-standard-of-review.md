### Decision Rejects Arizona ‘s Argument That School District’s Compliance With The No Child Left Behind Act Sufficiently Protects English Language Learner Civil Rights

The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, remanded Horne v. Flores to lower
federal courts, which must review additional factors to consider lifting a 2000
mandate for sufficient state funding to English Language Learners (ELLs)
programs in Nogales, Arizona. However, all 9 justices decisively rejected the
Arizona Superintendent’s claim that a state complying with the No Child Left
Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) automatically protects ELLs’ civil rights under the
Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA).

“The Supreme Court has rightfully found that EEOA provides ELLs with critical
and independent civil rights,” said Asian American Legal Defense and Education
Fund (AALDEF) Staff Attorney Khin Mai Aung. “We hope lower courts will apply the
new factors the high court set forth to preserve ELLs’ rights to continued
funding and support.”

AALDEF, along with 23 diverse youth groups and education advocates across the
country, submitted an amicus brief demonstrating that NCLB is inadequate to
protect ELLs’ educational rights. The high court’s ruling supports AALDEF’s
arguments, which document a rampant lack of ELL assessment and services,
inadequate interpretation and translation, insufficient teacher training and
certification, and general curricular inequality across the country. AALDEF
contended that these problems were particularly acute for discrete ELL
populations with particular needs (including speakers of smaller language
groups). In accordance with AALDEF’s brief, the high court affirmed EEOA’s
continuing relevance.

However, the Supreme Court’s new standard of review allows state officials
greater flexibility in undoing longstanding judgments by showing a change in
circumstances. Of particular concern is the majority’s express indication that
Nogales ‘s compliance with NCLB could constitute such a change in circumstances.
Nevertheless, in light of NCLB’s documented shortcomings and the vital
importance of ELL programs in helping all students learn English, we are hopeful
lower courts will preserve the 2000 judgment.
