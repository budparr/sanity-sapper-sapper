A three-judge panel has approved the new Congressional redistricting map for New York state in _Favors v. Cuomo_. This new Congressional Map will now determine the election districts for the upcoming 2012 Congressional elections.

“The new Congressional redistricting map is a significant achievement in protecting the voting rights of the growing Asian American voting population in New York State and providing them equal representation,” said Jerry Vattamala, staff attorney at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF).

AALDEF has been at the forefront of advocating for the Asian American community in the Congressional redistricting process, including drafting and submitting its own redistricting proposal, the [Unity Map](/updates/unity-map/), in conjunction with a multiracial coalition of civil rights groups, as well as filing a complaint-in-intervention on behalf of Asian American voters in _Favors_ _v. Cuomo_.  _(For a summary of AALDEF’s recent advocacy in the Congressional redistricting process, see below.)_

“We have fought for the voting rights of Asian Americans throughout every step of the Congressional redistricting process, and we are pleased that the new map takes into account our advocacy,” said Vattamala.

**Asian American Representation Under the New Congressional Redistricting Map**

Under the new Congressional map, **District 6** (Asian VAP 37.9% ) corresponds to AALDEF’s Unity Map by retaining the Asian American community in Queens (in Flushing/Bayside, Elmhurst and Briarwood/Jamaica Hills) within one district. After the incumbent representative for the District 6 Congressional seat announced last week that he will not run, District 6 is now an open congressional seat for the 2012 elections.

“There is now an open Congressional seat in Queens with a significant Asian American population, which provides a tremendous opportunity for Asian Americans in New York to have their interests represented in Congress,” said Vattamala.

Because of the significant Asian American population, poll sites in Queens (where District 6 is located) are required under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act to provide voting language assistance and bilingual ballots in Chinese, Korean, and, since the 2010 Census, Asian Indian.

“Given the expected Asian American turnout for the primary and general election, it is imperative that language assistance be provided in the designated languages,” said Vattamala.

Apart from District 6, the following Congressional districts likewise adhere to AALDEF’s recommendations with regard to keeping Asian American communities together:

* District 7 (Asian VAP 19.8%) likewise adheres to the Unity Map by keeping the community of interest in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Brooklyn’s Sunset Park within one district.
* District 14 (Asian VAP 16.1%) retains the Asian American community of interest in Jackson Heights and Woodside, Queens within one district.
* District 5 (Asian VAP 11.5%) retains the Asian American community of interest in Richmond Hill/South Ozone Park within one district.
