As the speeches ended, Asian Americans were at the start of the 50th anniversary
of the March on Washington.

I was in front of the march banner and took this photo. I could see Rev. Al
Sharpton and Rep. John Lewis. For a brief moment, they held the pose and then it
began–a massive non-stop flow of humanity demanding civil rights and justice,
emanating from in front of the Lincoln Memorial and onto Independence Avenue.I
stood like a tree but knew I would get run over, as I was facing the march and
it was coming right at me. So I danced through it to the open spaces until I was
saw some Asian Americans and started marching with them. It was Todd Endo and
the folks from NCAPA, the first large group of Asian Americans I saw at the
march.

Endo was a young Oberlin College student when he marched in 1963. Now an Asian
American activist, Endo held up a picture of the original Asian American
marchers with the Japanese American Citizens League.

As we marched down Independence Avenue, I talked with Endo on this [exclusive
podcast](https://bit.ly/17TCNlc), about how things had changed and how the march
gives him optimism for the future.
