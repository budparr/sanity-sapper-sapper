On October 2, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will join University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) student associations, We Support UT and the Multicultural Engagement Center, for a night of learning and dialogue around the _Fisher v. UT-Austin_ affirmative action case. The event will be held at UT-Austin on **Tuesday, October 2 in Burdine 106 from 7pm to 9pm.**

AALDEF Educational Equity attorney **Thomas Mariadason** will speak on a panel with **Damon Hewitt**, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (NAACP LDF), and **Karolina Lyznik**, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF). **Dr. Eric Tang** of the Center for Asian American Studies and African & African Diaspora Studies at UT-Austin will moderate the panel, with UT-Austin students taking part in the discussion.

“Asian Americans are often used as a wedge group in the debate over diversity considerations despite our community’s steadfast support for affirmative action,” said Mariadason. “We welcome this opportunity to engage with students at UT-Austin and openly discuss the role of diversity in making UT-Austin the dynamic learning environment that it is.”

In August, AALDEF [filed an _amicus_ brief](/press-release/aaldef-amicus-brief-supreme-court-uphold-race-conscious-admissions-university-texas/) urging the Supreme Court to uphold UT-Austin’s use of diversity considerations in its admissions process for promoting equal opportunity for all Americans. Opening arguments in _Fisher_ will begin in the Supreme Court on October 10.

The October 2 town hall will provide UT-Austin students a chance to learn about the _Fisher_ case from a multi-racial coalition of national civil rights organizations and share ideas on voicing support for the University of Texas at Austin.
