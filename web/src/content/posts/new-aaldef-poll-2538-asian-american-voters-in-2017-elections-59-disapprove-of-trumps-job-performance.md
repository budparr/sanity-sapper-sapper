According to a nonpartisan exit poll of 2,538 Asian American voters in the 2017 elections, Asian Americans strongly supported Democratic candidates in four states–Virginia, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York–with 3 out of 5 voters disapproving of Donald Trump’s performance as president. The multilingual exit poll was conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), a New York-based national organization that has surveyed Asian American voters since 1988.

“Asian American voters, many of whom are not enrolled in any political party, could be a decisive voting bloc in the 2018 midterm elections,” said AALDEF executive director Margaret Fung.

AALDEF conducted the exit poll at 33 poll sites in the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral elections in Boston and New York City. Of those surveyed, 66% were Democrats, 10% were Republicans, and 21% were not enrolled in any party.

In the race for governor in Virginia, 26% of Asian American voters said that they were not affiliated with any party. 45% four years ago, 58% were affiliated with the Democratic Party – a 13% increase from our exit poll four years ago. 15% were affiliated with the Republican Party.

In New Jersey, an overwhelming majority (72%) of Asian American voters favored Democrat Phil Murphy over Republican Kim Guadagno (21%). 60% polled were enrolled as Democrats, 23% said they were not enrolled in any party, and 12% were enrolled as Republicans.

Asian American voters in these four states voiced their opinions on several current topics:

* _Donald Trump Job Approval_: 59% Disapprove, 22% Approve and 19% Don’t Know
* _Repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)_:51% Oppose Repeal, 29% Support Repeal,    20% Don’t Know
* _Continuing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)_: 64% Support, 18% Oppose, 18%     Don’t Know
* _State of Race Relations in the U.S._: 53% Bad, 47% Good (Massachusetts not included)

“There is tremendous political diversity within the Asian American community,” said Jerry Vattamala, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “Traditionally, issues and candidates have driven the Asian American vote. However, many Asian Americans increasingly are registering as Democrats and supporting the party’s policies on such issues as health care and immigration.”

**2017 ASIAN AMERICAN EXIT POLL RESULTS**

AALDEF conducted the exit poll of 2,538 Asian American voters at 33 poll sites in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia in English and ten Asian languages: Bengali, Chinese,  Gujarati, Hindi, Khmer, Korean, Punjabi, Tagalog, Urdu, and Vietnamese.

**ACCESS TO THE VOTE**

**41% of all Asian Americans polled read English less than “very well.”**

Across all ethnic groups, limited English proficiency was high. 41% of all Asian Americans polled read English less than “very well.” It is evident that language assistance is still needed to ensure Asian Americans can fully exercise their right to vote.

Under the Voting Rights Act, poll sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia are mandated to provide bilingual ballots and interpreters to voters who speak Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Khmer, and Gujarati, and Bengali. Some counties in Virginia voluntarily provided Korean interpreters at certain poll sites. 26% percent of all respondents preferred to use some form of language assistance to vote.

**Asian American voters also faced a number of barriers in exercising their right to vote.**

The following voting problems in the 2017 elections were reported to AALDEF:

* Elderly LEP voters in Boston’s Chinatown complained that their absentee ballots were completed by persons other than themselves. These voters requested that their absentee ballots be invalidated, and that they be allowed to vote in person on Election Day. The City of Boston translates Election Day ballots into Chinese and Vietnamese, but does not translate absentee ballots.
* Voters in New York City were not informed of poll site changes.
* In Virginia, voters received text messages instructing them to go to incorrect poll sites.
* Asian American candidates in Edison and Hoboken, New Jersey were targets of anonymous racist and anti-immigrant flyers.
* Interpreter shortages at several polling places made voting difficult for limited English proficient voters.
* Voters reported encounters with hostile poll workers, excessive demands for identification, broken voting machines, and misdirection by poll workers.

AALDEF reported all of these voter problems to the appropriate state and local elections officials.

**About the Asian American Exit Poll:**
