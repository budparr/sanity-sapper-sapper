New York City…The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), a
42-year old national civil rights organization, will dispatch more than 800
attorneys, law students, and community volunteers to polling places in 14 states
and Washington, DC to document voting problems in the 2016 elections. AALDEF
will also conduct a nonpartisan multilingual exit poll in 12 languages to get a
snapshot of Asian American voting preferences.

Margaret Fung, AALDEF executive director, said: “We want to ensure that all
eligible Asian Americans can participate in the electoral process and have their
votes counted in this important presidential election.” She said that AALDEF
plans to poll 10,000 Asian American voters on Election Day at polling places in
64 cities in 14 states: New York, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania,
Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

**POLL MONITORING**

Responding to a wave of new state voter identification and proof of citizenship
laws, AALDEF will monitor more than 100 poll sites to ensure compliance with the
Voting Rights Act and the Help America Vote Act. These polling places are in
areas with large numbers of newly-registered Asian American voters;
jurisdictions in which Asian-language assistance is provided; and sites where
Asian Americans have reported voting barriers or intimidation in recent
elections. Attorneys will check whether Asian-language voting assistance has
been provided (such as ballots, interpreters, signs and voting materials) and
whether provisional ballots are offered to voters whose names are not in voter
lists. Attorneys will report on whether voter identification requirements are
implemented in a non-discriminatory manner.

Jerry Vattamala, AALDEF Democracy Program Director, said, “In the 2012 elections, Asian Americans had to overcome numerous obstacles to exercise their right to vote. AALDEF volunteers identified mistranslated ballots, interpreter shortages that led to Asian American voters being turned away, and poll workers who made hostile and racist remarks about Asian American voters.  AALDEF will guard against the disenfranchisement of new citizens and limited English proficient voters.” Citing a 2016 [AALDEF case](/press-release/federal-court-blocks-texas-law-restricting-language-assistance-to-voters/)
in which a Texas election law was struck down under the Voting Rights Act
because it improperly restricted access to interpreters, Vattamala said he
received a complaint this week from an Asian American voter improperly denied
language assistance during early voting in Texas.

**MULTILINGUAL ASIAN AMERICAN EXIT POLL**

AALDEF will conduct a nonpartisan exit poll of Asian American voters in 12 languages: Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Khmer, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, and English. Voters will be asked how they voted in the presidential, U.S. Senate, and Congressional races, the top reasons for their choices, their party affiliations, whether they are first-time voters, use of Asian-language voting assistance, and specific problems encountered at the polls.  The AALDEF Asian American Exit Poll reveals vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. In the [2012 presidential election](/uploads/pdf/Asian%20American%20Vote%202012.pdf) AALDEF polled
9,096 Asian American voters in 14 states, the largest poll of its kind in the
nation, and found that among Asian American voters polled:

–79% were foreign-born naturalized U.S. citizens;  
–27% were first-time voters;   
–37% were limited English proficient;   
–57% were Democrats, 14% were Republicans; 27% were not enrolled in any political party;   
–77% voted for Barack Obama and 21% voted for Mitt Romney.   
  
AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988, noting the steadily increasing numbers of new citizen and first-time voters.

**MULTILINGUAL VOTER HOTLINE: 800-966-5946**

Multilingual volunteers will be at poll sites to take complaints from voters about election irregularities and other barriers to voting. Voters can also report Election Day problems to AALDEF’s toll-free hotline at 800-966-5946, or by e-mail at votingrights@aaldef.org.AALDEF is partnering with 121 national and local groups, law firms, and student associations to mobilize volunteers for Election Day.
