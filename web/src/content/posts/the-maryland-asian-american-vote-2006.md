Invite you to a special presentation on

**The Maryland Asian American Vote 2006**

In the November 2006 midterm elections over 250 Asian American voters in Silver Spring, Rockville, and Kensington were surveyed as part of AALDEFs national multilingual exit poll. The exit poll—the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind in the nation—was conducted in 23 cities in 9 states.

At this special presentation, comparative information will be given about Asian American voting patterns, attitudes on immigration reform, important issues for the 2008 Presidential elections, first-time voters, party enrollment, English proficiency and voting barriers.

Speakers: State Delegates Susan Lee & Saqib Ali Jayne Park, APALRC Glenn Magpantay, AALDEF Chung Pak, KAA Hoan Dang, MVMA Raj Kudchadkar, MCIE Kamala Edwards, IAC Lily Qi, OCA.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 6:30 to 8:00 PM  Montgomery County Council Office Building Auditorium 100 Maryland Avenue Rockville, MD
