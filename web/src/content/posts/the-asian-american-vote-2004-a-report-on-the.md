## AALDEF Releases 2004 APA Vote Report

The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund released new findings from
its national multilingual exit poll of almost 11,000 Asian American voters in
the November 2004 Presidential Election, the largest nonpartisan survey of its
kind in the nation.

AALDEF’s new 24-page publication, **_The Asian American Vote 2004: A Report on
the Multilingual Exit Poll in the 2004 Presidential Election_**, provides a
snapshot of the voter preferences of Asian Americans in 20 cities in 8 states:
New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Michigan, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

The report includes detailed information about the following topics:

-   Vote for president and most important issue influencing choice of candidates
-   Party enrollment
-   First-time voters
-   Top immigrants’ rights issues
-   Foreign-born vs. native-born voters
-   Citizenship tenure (duration)
-   Main source of news
-   Ethnicity
-   English proficiency
-   Use of bilingual ballots
-   Voting barriers

AALDEF’s multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American
voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. AALDEF has
conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since
1988.

The 2004 multilingual exit poll was conducted in 23 Asian languages and
dialects. AALDEF worked with several community groups to mobilize 1,200
attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the multilingual exit poll
and to monitor polling places for incidents of voter discrimination.
