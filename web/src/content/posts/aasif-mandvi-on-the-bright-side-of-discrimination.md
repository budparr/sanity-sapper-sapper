Splitsider — _The Daily Show’s_ Aasif Mandvi closed out the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund’s Justice in Action Awards last week with a very funny speech (which, he noted, may also be used as an NYPD training video). AALDEF’s work is great and all, but Mandvi makes a compelling case for them to stop their fight against discrimination and let him continue having fun scaring white people on airplanes. I mean, if we all respected each other’s beliefs as human beings, how would we play hilarious pranks on bigots? It would be so boring.
