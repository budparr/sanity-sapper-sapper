WNYC — The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was part of
the coalition that released the Unity Maps, sent out a review of the new
redistricting proposal. While they were happy to see an increase in
Asian-majority districts, the statement wasn’t without qualification:

> SD 16 – Under LATFOR’s proposal, there is one Asian
> American majority State Senate district (52.20% Non-Hispanic Asian
> voting age population (VAP)), which includes Flushing, Queens.
> Currently, there are no Asian American majority Senate districts.
> “We’re glad that LATFOR recognized the importance of creating a
> majority Asian American Senate district,” said AALDEF Executive Director
> Margaret Fung. “But the contorted district lines of SD 16 split the
> neighborhood of Flushing. A compact district in Flushing-Bayside should
> be drawn to keep Asian American communities of interest together in
> these neighborhoods, as we demonstrated in the Unity Map.”
>
> Under LATFOR’s proposal, there are three proposed majority Asian American State Assembly districts.
>
> …
>
> “As a general matter, we are pleased that LATFOR has increased the
> number of Asian American majority Assembly districts from one to three,”
> said Jerry Vattamala, staff attorney with AALDEF’s Democracy Project.
> He added that a majority Asian American Assembly district has also been
> created for the first time in Sunset Park and Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
>
> Under the Unity Map, AALDEF proposed four Asian American majority
> State Assembly districts, with the fourth in the neighborhood of
> Elmhurst.
>
> “While AD 49 is similar to our Unity Map, the South Asian community
> of Richmond Hill-South Ozone Park continues to remain divided between
> multiple State Assembly districts,” said Vattamala. “The Unity Map would
> have kept the Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park neighborhoods
> substantially together within a single Assembly district.”

Many of these groups are going to start releasing their own detailed analysis of
the LATFOR lines-as AALDEF says it will-so stay tuned.
