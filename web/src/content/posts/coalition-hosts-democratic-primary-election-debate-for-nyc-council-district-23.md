A citywide coalition of non-profit community-based, advocacy, and social service organizations announced a non-partisan candidate debate for the Special Election in New York’s 23rd City Council District. The event is scheduled for Thursday, August 27th at 6:30 PM at the Hillside Banquet Hall (206-10 Hillside Avenue, Queens Village, NY 11427).

The district is home to a diverse constituency and has a population that is 40% Asian, 14% Hispanic and 12% Black. The hosts of the candidate debate hope to provide an informative venue for voters and residents of the 23rd City Council District to hear the candidates address important issues and voice their needs and concerns.  The district includes the neighborhoods of Bayside, Bellerose, Douglaston, Floral Park, Fresh Meadows, Glen Oaks, Hollis, Little Neck, New Hyde Park, Oakland Gardens, and Queens Village.

The Special Primary Election for City Council will be held on Thursday, September 10, and the general election will be held on Tuesday, November 3.  In May, City Council Member Mark Weprin announced his resignation. The Democratic primary contest is being closely watched with six candidates – Celia Dosamantes, Bob Friedrich, Barry Grodenchik, Rebecca Lynch, Ali Najmi, and Satnam Parhar – vying for the nomination.  All candidates have confirmed their participation in the debate.
