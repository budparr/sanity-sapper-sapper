The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 369 Asian American voters in New Orleans, Louisiana in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that Asian Americans backed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and a large percentage was undecided about immigration reform.

81% of Asian Americans polled in New Orleans, Louisiana voted for Mitt Romney for President, compared to 21% of those polled nationally. Of those surveyed, 51% were enrolled in the Republican Party, while only 7% were enrolled in the Democratic Party; 39% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party.

The major factors influencing the Asian American vote in Louisiana were economy/jobs (56%), health care (33%), education (28%), terrorism/security (18%), civil rights/immigrants rights (14%), and women’s issues (12%).

“The New Orleans exit poll results show the diversity within the Asian American community and the wide range of political leanings,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of the Democracy Program at AALDEF.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s 14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters in jurisdictions with large Asian American populations. In Orleans Parish, Vietnamese Americans were 98% of the Asian Americans surveyed. More than 1 in 4 (29%) were first-time voters.

Glenn Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 multilingual exit poll at the Vietnamese American Young Leaders Association of New Orleans (VAYLA) Community Center. [View the presentation >](/uploads/pdf/AALDEF%202012%20Exit%20Poll%20Presentation%20Louisiana.pdf)
