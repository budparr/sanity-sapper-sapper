November 8, 2013 – According to the results of an exit poll in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, Asian American voters are open to candidates of both political parties in key states. The nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 2,290 Asian American voters was conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) after the mayoral election in New York and the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia.

“Asian American voters in Virginia, many of whom are not enrolled in any political party, could be a decisive voting bloc in the 2014 midterm elections,” said AALDEF executive director Margaret Fung.

AALDEF released preliminary results of its exit poll conducted at 24 poll sites in New York, New Jersey, and Virginia. Of those surveyed in total, 62% were enrolled in the Democratic Party, 10% were enrolled in the Republican Party, and 26% were not enrolled in any party.

However, in the close race for governor in Virginia, 45% indicated that they were not affiliated with any party, 41% were affiliated with the Democratic Party, and 11% were affiliated with the Republican Party.

In New Jersey, a majority (54%) of Asian American voters favored Republican Chris Christie over Democrat Barbara Buono (42%). 51% polled were enrolled as Democrats, 37% said they were not enrolled in any party, and 11% were enrolled as Republicans.

New York had the highest number of Asian American registered Democratic voters, with 70% were enrolled in the Democratic Party, 18% not enrolled in any party, and 9% enrolled in the Republican Party.

“There is tremendous political diversity within the Asian American community,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “Issues and candidates drive the Asian American vote, rather than party affiliation. For candidates concerned with the issues that matter most to our community, the Asian American vote is up for grabs.”

**ACCESS TO THE VOTE**

**50% of all Asian Americans polled read English less than “very well.”**

Across all ethnic groups, limited English proficiency was high. 50% of all Asian Americans polled read English less than “very well.” Language assistance is needed to ensure Asian Americans can fully exercise their right to vote.

Some counties Virginia voluntarily provided Korean interpreters at certain poll sites. 30% percent of all respondents preferred to use some form of language assistance to vote.

**Asian American voters also faced a number of barriers in exercising their right to vote.**

One contested ballot proposition in New York was mistranslated. Interpreter shortages made voting difficult for limited English proficient voters.

–  12 had to vote by provisional ballot

All of these voter problems were reported to the state and local elections officials.
