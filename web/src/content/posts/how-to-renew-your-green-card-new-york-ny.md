As of May 31, 2005, all applications to renew or replace a green card must be mailed to and filed with the U.S.Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) located in Los Angles where all such applications are now processed. The mailing addresses for USCIS in Los Angeles are listed on the back page. The USCIS will send you an appointment date to visit an ASC so that you can be fingerprinted. The Application Support Centers for New York City are listed on the back page. The appointment letter will give you the address of one of these centers. You may also use the USCIS website listed below to file your application and request an appointment. If you are ineligible for electronic filing, you must mail a completed I-90 Form Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (green card) to the USCIS in Los Angeles. This form can be obtained and printed from the website at www.uscis.gov or by calling the USCIS at 1-800-870-3676. You should mail the following:

1. A completed I-90 Form;
2. A check or money order for $ 365.00 for the filing fee and another check or money order for $ 85.00 for fingerprinting;

   Make them payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security;
3. A copy of expiring green card (both sides) if available; and
4. Identification such as drivers license, passport, or a state issued identification card with a picture of you. (Mail only copies.)
