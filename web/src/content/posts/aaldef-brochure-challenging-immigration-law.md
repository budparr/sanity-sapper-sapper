AALDEF will defend the rights of immigrants against local and state enforcement of immigration laws by doing community education and outreach, conducting advocacy at the federal, state and local level, and offering legal representation to individuals whose rights have been violated.

Organizations that would like to schedule a “know your rights” training, conduct outreach on this issue, or refer individuals in need of legal representation should contact AALDEF at 212.966.5932 for assistance.
