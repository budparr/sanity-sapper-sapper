The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and Advocates for Children of New York (AFC) released their report, “Policy Recommendations: Effective Accountability Mechanisms for New York State’s English Language Learners (ELLs),” which provides guidelines for successful accountability provisions for the 238,792 ELLs currently enrolled in New York State’s public schools.

As of the start of the 2012-13 school year, the State’s current accountability system continues to fall short with regards to its large ELL population. There is a continuing need for improved curricula, language assessments, and teacher training and evaluations for ELLs. AALDEF’s and AFC’s report provides the key principles for a sound ELL accountability framework in New York State. 

AALDEF and AFC originally submitted this report to the State Department of Education’s School and District Accountability Think Tank in 2011. In May of 2012, several recommendations from the report were included in the U.S. Department of Education grant of the State’s waiver application from Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).
