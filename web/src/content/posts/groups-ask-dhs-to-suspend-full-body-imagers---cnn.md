**Washington** — By Mike M. Ahlers. More than 30 privacy and civil liberties
groups are asking the Department of Homeland Security to suspend the use of
full body imagers at airports, saying there is evidence that privacy
safeguards don’t work and the devices are not effective. In a petition filed
Wednesday, the groups also said the machines — which see through travelers’
clothes — violate people’s “deeply held religious beliefs.”

The Transportation Security Administration has sped up deployment of the
machines after a man with explosives sewn into his underwear attempted to bomb a
plane on Christmas Day. About 46 machines are in place in 23 airports, and the
agency plans to have about 1,000 set up by the end of 2011.

The TSA has steadfastly defended the effectiveness and safety of the machines
and says extensive precautions are taken to protect the identities of those who
go through them.

But in a petition released Wednesday, the coalition of groups said the machines
are “uniquely intrusive” and violate
[travelers](https://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Air_Travel)‘ Fourth Amendment
rights against unreasonable search.

“At this point, there is no question that the body scanner program should be
shut down,” Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, said in a prepared statement. “This is the worst type of government
boondoggle — expensive, ineffective and offensive to Constitutional rights and
deeply held religious beliefs.”

Security expert Bruce Schneier called the machines “one more example of security
theater.”

The head of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund said the use of
the machines “has violated and will continue to violate the civil rights of
Muslims and other religious groups.”

Rotenberg said the groups may seek legal action if the DHS does not act on the
petition.

Rotenberg and TSA has tussled over the issue of whether the imagers can retain
images. In a February 24 letter to the chairman of the House Homeland Security
Committee, TSA said the machines “have the capability to retain and export
images only for testing, training and evaluation purposes.”

“Machines are delivered to airports without the capability to store, print or
transmit images, and cannot be modified by the operators,” it said. “There are
no circumstances when the system would be entered into the test mode in an
airport environment,” TSA’s acting administrator Gale Rossides wrote in the
letter.

Rotenberg said the use of the word “would” instead of “could” is intended to
conceal the true capabilities of the machines. The machines can be altered at
any site to retain and export images, he said.

In recent weeks, the TSA has publicized the machines’ effectiveness in detecting
contraband. In the first year of deployment, the machines found about 60
“artfully concealed” illegal or prohibited items, TSA said.

While no explosives have been detected, the machine’s ability to spot even small
concealed objects demonstrates its effectiveness as a
[security](https://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Transportation_Security) tool,
officials said.

“It is absolutely a tremendous improvement of what we can detect at the
checkpoints,” Rossides told CNN earlier this month. “It is an excellent piece of
technology that will significantly improve our detection capabilities.”

Screeners using the technology have found concealed drugs, a knife secreted in
the small of a person’s back at a Richmond, Virginia, airport, a concealed razor
blade on a passenger at a Phoenix, Arizona, airport and other concealed items
such as large bottles of lotion, which are prohibited as carry-on items.

In addition, the machines have revealed numerous prohibited items that
passengers evidently inadvertently left in pockets. Those items are confiscated
but are not counted in the tally, a TSA spokesman said.

“The amazing thing is that our officers, as they get more and more familiar with
this technology, are actually finding very, very small things that are being
secreted on the body,” Rossides said.

The organizations signing the petition include EPIC, AALDEF, BORDC, the Council
on Islamic-American Relations, the Center for the Study of Responsive Law, the
Liberty Coalition and Public Citizen.
