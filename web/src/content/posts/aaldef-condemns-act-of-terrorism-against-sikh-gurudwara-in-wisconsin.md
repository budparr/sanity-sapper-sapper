![240](/uploads/240_Sikh%20Temple%20Massacre.jpg)On Sunday, a horrific mass shooting took place at the Sikh gurudwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, as members of the Sikh community were preparing for a peaceful religious gathering. It has been reported that a white male killed six people, and he was later killed himself after exchanging fire with a police officer.  
  
AALDEF condemns this blatant act of terrorism against innocent people at a house of worship, and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, the three continuing to fight for their lives in critical condition, and the entire Sikh community in Oak Creek, whose lives have been changed and feeling of safety shattered.  
  
While details continue to emerge on this tragedy, the 700,000 Sikhs living in the United States have increasingly been victims of hate and discrimination. The media coverage following this tragedy, including CNN Network's disturbing decision to distinguish Sikhs and Muslims, which implicitly suggested an attack on Muslims is within expectation, and its initial hesitation to call this an act of terrorism, show how severely intolerance and ignorance have been allowed to persist in our country, and the immediate need to stop it in all of its forms.  
  
As more information comes to light, AALDEF will seek to work with other social justice organizations in making policy recommendations in hopes that such tragedies can be prevented in the future.
