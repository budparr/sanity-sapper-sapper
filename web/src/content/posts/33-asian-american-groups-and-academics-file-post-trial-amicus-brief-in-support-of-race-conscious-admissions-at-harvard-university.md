The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and 32 Asian American groups and higher education faculty filed a post-trial amicus brief on Wednesday, urging a Massachusetts federal court to reject the claim that Harvard's admissions policies intentionally discriminate against Asian Americans.

The lawsuit, _Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v. Harvard University_, was filed in 2014 by a conservative activist committed to dismantling affirmative action. A three-day trial in Boston ended on November 2, 2018, after several students of color, including Asian Americans, testified about the benefits of race-conscious admissions and a diverse educational environment.

Margaret Fung, AALDEF executive director, said: "Significantly, not a single Asian American applicant offered testimony claiming to be a victim of discrimination. Harvard's individualized admissions process, which takes race into account, actually helps to dispel the harmful ‘model minority’ myth by recognizing the vast ethnic, language, and socioeconomic diversity within the Asian American community."

The post-trial amicus brief dispels misperceptions about Harvard's consideration of "personal factors" in the admissions process and cites deficiencies in the limited statistical analysis by SFFA's expert witness. SFFA’s analysis excluded consideration of almost one-third of the students who were admitted, including athletes and the children of employees and alumni. As Harvard’s expert demonstrated, when this evidence was included in the statistical analysis, there was no discrimination against Asian Americans.

Ken Kimerling, AALDEF legal director and one of the attorneys for Amici, pointed out that very little of SFFA's evidence at trial dealt with Harvard’s treatment of Asian Americans. Kimerling said: “Now that the trial is over, it is clear that Asian Americans were simply used by SFFA, whose agenda was not to help Asians but to oppose affirmative action for Blacks and Latinos. We have not identified any direct or circumstantial evidence sufficient to prove that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian Americans, and we urge the Court to find in favor of Harvard’s race-conscious admissions program.”

Foley Hoag LLP is pro bono co-counsel representing the Amici.
