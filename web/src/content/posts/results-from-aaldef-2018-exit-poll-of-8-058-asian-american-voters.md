New York...According to updated results of the November 6, 2018 exit poll by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), Asian American voters in 14 states strongly favored Democratic candidates in races for Governor (75%), Senate (81%) and House of Representatives (79%) in the November midterm elections.

AALDEF's multilingual exit poll of 8,058 Asian American voters was conducted in English and 11 Asian languages in collaboration with 88 national and local community groups--the largest survey of its kind in the nation.

Margaret Fung, AALDEF executive director, said: "The AALDEF multilingual exit poll provides detailed information about Asian American voters that is often overlooked by mainstream polls. Their strong support for Democratic candidates in 2018 reflected their opposition to Trump's performance as president and his anti-immigrant policies."

The 2018 Asian American Exit Poll provides a unique snapshot of the voting patterns of Asian Americans in 14 states with large or fast-growing Asian American populations: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Michigan, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, California, and Washington, DC. It was conducted at 80 poll sites in 50 cities in 12 languages: Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Khmer, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, and English.

AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. In the 2014 midterm elections, AALDEF polled 4,102 Asian American voters in 11 states.

Selected 2018 exit poll highlights:

· Among the 8,058 Asian American voters polled, the largest Asian ethnic groups were Chinese (32%), South Asian (32%), Vietnamese (9%), Korean (9%), and Filipino (7%).

· 15% of Asian Americans were first-time voters, an increase from 10% in the 2014 midterm elections.

· 72% of Asian American voters were foreign-born naturalized citizens (84% in 2014).

· 28% of Asian American voters were limited English proficient (“LEP”) (45% in 2014).

· 61% of Asian Americans were registered Democrats (57% in 2014), 23% were not enrolled in a political party (26% in 2014), and 12% were registered Republicans (14% in 2014).
