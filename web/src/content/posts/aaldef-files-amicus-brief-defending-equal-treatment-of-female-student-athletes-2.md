In May, AALDEF filed an _amicus_ brief before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in _Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High School District_ along with the National Women's Law Center and 19 other civil rights organizations. The case concerns several questions concerning equal treatment of women and girls in athletics. Our brief defends the continuing validity and practicality of the Department of Education Office For Civil Rights' three-part test to determine the availability of equal athletic opportunities, as well as the need to allow class retaliation suits - especially given the context of the coach/team relationship. AALDEF joined this effort due to its interest in the intersection of racial and gender discrimination, and in ensuring equal treatment of Asian American women and girls in athletics. The law firm of Wilmer Hale provided _pro bono_ assistance.
