AOL/Huffington Post -- If you've ever received a speedy $10 manicure, there's a good chance that the woman who buffed your nails was paid less than minimum wage, denied overtime, and suffered emotional abuse. At least that's what salon workers and attorneys claim in a spate of lawsuits.  
  
The latest, a nationwide class action suit on behalf of 13 salon workers, alleges that XpresSpa, the largest global network of [premium airport salons](http://www.xpresspa.com/spas-a/204.htm), is guilty of a host of "systematic" labor law violations, according to the women's attorney, C.

\-- The cosmetic industry essentially regulates itself, thanks to laws that haven't been updated since 1938 -- so salons are rife with toxic products that have been linked to reproductive problems and cancer.   

**The Cost Of A Cheap Manicure**

As the nail salon industry exploded over the past few decades, salons engaged in a "race to the bottom," according to Shirley Lin, an attorney with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, exploiting their immigrant employees to keep prices low.  

Now these women workers are fighting back…
