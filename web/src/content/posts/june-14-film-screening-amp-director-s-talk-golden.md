Golden Venture tells the story of four Fujianese immigrants who came to the US on the freighter Golden Venture, which ran aground off New York City in June 1993 with 286 Chinese immigrants aboard. AALDEF Program Director Stan Mark and film director Peter Cohn will discuss the political issues surrounding their detention during the Clinton era and their legal limbo today. Golden Venture premiered at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival.

The screening will be followed by a Q&A session. The program is co-sponsored by AALDEF and the Museum of the Chinese in the Americas (MoCA).
