During the months of January and February, AALDEF attorney Jerry Vattamala will present statewide results of AALDEF's Asian American Exit Poll in the 2014 midterm elections. On Election Day, November 4, 2014, AALDEF conducted a nonpartisan exit poll of 4,102 Asian American voters in 11 Asian languages in 11 states. The exit poll reveals vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream media polls.

At these presentations, comparative information will be given about the Asian American vote in the 2014 gubernatorial and congressional elections, concerns about key issues, first-time voters, and profiles of the Asian American vote by ethnicity, nativity, party enrollment, age, and English proficiency.

RSVP to votingrights@aaldef.org, (subject line: Spring Presentation) or by phone, 800.966.5946 ext. 251. Light lunch/dinner will be provided.
