**Groups to File DOJ Complaint on Failing Language Services in New Orleans Schools**

**Press Conference August 2 at 10am**

_Asian American and Latino families to hold New Orleans school district accountable for ineffective ESL services and language access systems_

**New Orleans —** The Vietnamese American Young Leaders Association (VAYLA) and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will hold a press conference on **Friday, August 2 at 10am** to announce their complaint to the Department of Justice on behalf of limited-English proficient students and their parents in New Orleans schools. The complaint alleges that the school district has violated Title VI in failing to meet the language needs of Asian American and Latino limited-English proficient students.  District-wide, these students and their families have been underserved, severely damaging their quality of education and putting them at a huge disadvantage to attaining success in their schools.

Students and parents will speak about how they have been affected by the lack of language access in public schools.

**Press Conference Information:**

**Event:** Press Conference to Announce Complaint to DOJ on Failing Language Services in New Orleans Schools

**Date:** Friday, August 2, 2013 at 10am

**Location:** VAYLA, 13235 Chef Menteur Hwy, Suite A, New Orleans, LA 70129

Students, parents, and community members will also be available for interview following the press conference.

VAYLA youth leaders have been investigating educational equity and access issues for limited-English communities through youth participatory action research for over two years. In May 2013, Youth Organizing Unity (YOU2), a program of VAYLA, released a report, [_ESL: Lost in the System_](https://ryhcnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ESL-Lost-In-The-Sytem-2013.pdf), documenting the rights violations that English Language Learners (ELLs) and their families have endured at schools across New Orleans. Realizing the pervasiveness of these systematic education failures, VAYLA partnered with AALDEF to develop a complaint to the Department of Justice that would hold schools accountable for providing the highest quality of language services to students and language access for parents. We are hopeful that the schools identified in the complaint will begin removing the barriers holding back families from participating in receiving the education that they deserve.
