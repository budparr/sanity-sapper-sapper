**The Queens Museum of Art presents**

**Suitcases on Tour: Chanika Svetvilas & the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF)**

a program of Fatal Love ’06 

Saturday, August 19, 2006 

3:15 p.m.

Within the performance/installation **Suitcases on Tour**, red, orange, and yellow plexiglass suitcases, echoing the high security alert levels that have become a part of daily life in New York,will be carried into the Queens Museum from the park by Leadership Through the Arts Youth Program, teen docents and volunteer travelers, followed by a presentation by Mabel Tso, Community Organizer, **AALDEF**, and documentation of the journey. The suitcases echo paranoia and suspicion associated with unattended luggage during a time of heightened security. The images cut onto the surfaces of the suitcases reflect the recent proposed U.S. legislation to increase monitoring of immigrants, but also the impact on families and the relativity of borders and national identity. Challenging the notion of border control, a mobile immigration booth, co-designed by Miguel Baltiera, located right outside the museum and manned by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, will provide resources and answers to questions by the public.
