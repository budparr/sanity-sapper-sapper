![240](/uploads/240_Lin2.jpg)Houston Chronicle -- Though ESPN apologized for an offensive comment made about New York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin, an Asian-American civil rights organization isn't satisfied with the response, [**The Huffington Post reported**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/19/espn-apologizes-for-racis_n_1287503.html)**.**

> The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, an organization that promotes civil rights for Asian Americans, wants the network to do even more.
>
> In a statement posted its site, the AALDEF said that the term used was "inexcusable" and wants ESPN to apologize on air so that "it is clear to all viewers that this racist language is unacceptable."

Meanwhile, ESPN anchor Max Bretos, who faces a 30-day suspension for using the same phrase when referring to Lin, [**is defending himself on Twitter:**](https://twitter.com/#%21/mbretosESPN)

> Wanted 2 apologize 2 all those I have upset. Not done with any racial reference. Despite intention,phrase was inappropriate in this context.
>
> My wife is Asian, would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and that community.
>
> I have learned from this will make every effort to avoid something similar happening again.

ESPN fired an employee Sunday who wrote an offensive headline about Lin, who has garnered national attention over the past few weeks**.**

> "I don't think it was on purpose or whatever, but (at) the same time they have apologized. And so from my end I don't care anymore," Lin said after leading the Knicks to a 104-97 win over Dallas on Sunday. "Have to learn to forgive, and I don't even think that was intentional. Or hopefully not."

ESPN apologized for the headline in a statement on Sunday.
