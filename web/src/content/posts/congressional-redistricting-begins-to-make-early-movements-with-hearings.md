Newark Independent Examiner — As the focus around the state heats up with legislative elections approaching in a couple weeks, there is an underground focus on congressional redistricting that will likely take the place of the legislative elections amongst conversation in the state. Legislative redistricting during the first three months of the year was heated, it exemplified the divide between members of both parties, and displayed the importance of one side “winning” when the map was ultimately released. That same combination of feelings, opinions, and sentiments are already starting to build as the state will have to decide how to draw a map that currently includes thirteen congressional districts, but will only have twelve come January.

Last month, the 13-member commission given the task and
responsibility of crafting the new congressional map began the early
discussions on the road to January’s decision. The 13-member commission
is made up of six Democrats led by former Assembly Speaker Joseph
Roberts and six Republicans led by Michael DuHaime, a political
strategist for multiple Republicans over the years including Governor
Chris Christie. The 13th member and likely tiebreaker on votes and the
final map is John Farmer, Jr., the former state Attorney General. The
chosen thirteen will have a harder task than their predecessors of a
decade ago, who chose to ensure incumbent safety with the state’s
representation number not changing after the census’ results.

The current makeup of the state’s delegation in Congress is seven
Democrats and six Republicans. Democrats have and will continue to argue
to maintain their majority advantage, which would become 7-5. While
Republicans, after picking up a seat in 2010, have and will continue to
make the argument that New Jersey is not as blue or Democratic as it
once was perceived to be and would ultimately like to see a map with a
6-6 representation. Democrats were able to obtain a more desireable map
in the wake of congressional redistricting with the tiebreaker and
Rutgers professor Alan Rosenthal favoring more elements of their map
over the Republican map and its suggestions. Democrats hope for a repeat
while Republican hope for redemption.

It is almost like a game of political career roulette or musical
chairs as Ingrid Reed, a policy analyst from the Eagleton Institute for
New Jersey Politics, explained;

> _**“You have 13 chairs on the floor and 13 people, and you take one away and one of those people won’t have a chair.”**_

In the wake of the first meeting of the commission, DuHaime felt;

> “I think we can look to our leaders in the
> governor’s office and state Legislature as an example of how we can work
> together to make sure we achieve a result that’s in everyone’s best
> interest.”

DuHaime will certainly work to lead the Republicans’ effort to create that balanced map of 6-6.

While Roberts expressed,

> _**“The map should be one that reflects the geography, the diversity, and perhaps the political history of New Jersey.”**_

That history Roberts’ points to is the current majority Democrats
hold amongst the congressional members and the fact that there are
roughly 700,000 more registered Democrats in the state.

What could be promising for both parties is the fact that Farmer is
very much undecided and came into the early meetings open-minded and
viewing nothing as predetermined. As he would outline,

> “The reality is New Jersey is losing a seat
> in Congress so it’s likely to be protracted negotiations before any map
> is adopted. We will try to balance all of the interests of New Jersey
> (while deciding on the map).”

DuHaime is joined on the Republican side by: former Burlington County
Freeholder Director Aubrey Fenton, Morris County attorney Eric Jaso,
Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande, Cape May Freeholder Susan Sheppard,
and Sherine El-Abd of Clifton. Roberts is joined on the Democratic side
by: former Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz-Perez, former Assemblyman Michael
Baker of East Brunswick, former Bill Pascrell Chief of Staff Ed Farmer,
former Corzine deputy chief-of-staff Jeannine LaRue of Trenton, and
Essex County Democratic Committee Chairman Phil Thigpen.

A month after the 13-member congressional redistricting commission
sat down to begin initial talks on this year’s redistricting process as
well as to set up future hearings, a major pair of those hearings
occurred last week. For anyone who followed the legislative
redistricting process, they might see history about to repeat itself
again as some passionate conversation has already entered the debate.

At the first hearing, taking place in Newark, racial and ethnical
representation was at the core of the conversation. During legislative
redistricting talks, similar conversation was taking place pertaining to
cities like Newark and the rising minority population especially
Hispanics in the state. “Communities of interest” that properly
represented racial and religious were argued by multiple individuals.

One of those individuals arguing for such areas was Jerry Vattamala, an
attorney with the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund. As
Vattamala expressed,

> “Asian-American communities of interest
> should be kept whole. The time to correct this injustice is now. The 9th
> congressional district (represented by Congressman Steve Rothman
> (D-NJ9)) should be expanded northward (to include more Asians).”
