The exit poll—the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind in the nation—was conducted in 23 cities in 9 states.

At this first-ever presentation, special comparative information will be given about Asian American voting patterns, attitudes on immigration reform, important issues for the 2008 Presidential elections, first-time voters, party enrollment, English proficiency and voting barriers.
