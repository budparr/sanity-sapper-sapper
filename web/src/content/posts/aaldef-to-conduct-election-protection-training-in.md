#### Attorneys, Law Students, and Volunteers to Review Federal Voting Rights Laws and Documentation of Voting Rights

 

Boston, MA—The **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF)**, a 32-year-old civil rights group, will train volunteers for its **Massachusetts Election Protection 2006** efforts on Wednesday, October 18 at 12 noon and at 5:30 p.m. On Election Day, November 7, AALDEF will dispatch pro bono attorneys, law students, and volunteers to 28 poll sites in Boston, Dorchester, Lowell, and Quincy to ensure compliance with federal voting rights laws.

**What:** AALDEF Elections Monitoring Training for Massachusetts Volunteers

**Date:** Wednesday, October 18, 2006

**Times/Addresses:**   
12 noon Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, 101 Federal Street  
5:30 p.m. Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, 100 Federal Street

_Both locations are in Boston, MA. Media outlets must RSVP to slin(at)aaldef.org to film or photograph specific trainings and to arrange for building clearance._

Said AALDEF staff attorney **Glenn D. Magpantay**, "In recent elections, our Election Protection volunteers have identified egregiously mistranslated ballots, interpreter shortages that led to Asian American voters being turned away, and poll workers who made hostile and racist remarks about Asian American voters. This year, volunteers will guard against the disenfranchisement of new citizens or limited English proficient voters that could tarnish the results of local or federal races."

In 2005, AALDEF supported the Justice Department’s **Voting Rights Act lawsuit** against the City of Boston that resulted in a settlement requiring that ballots be translated into Chinese, Vietnamese, and Spanish. Also that year, AALDEF volunteers conducted an exit poll of Asian American voters in Massachusetts, in English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Khmer, about their voting experiences and candidate preferences.

This year, on November 7, AALDEF will evaluate the availability of Chinese and Vietnamese bilingual ballots and voter notices in **Boston**.

In **Lowell**, AALDEF will ensure that new citizen voters, especially the Cambodian American community, appear in the voter rolls and will not be turned away from poll sites without being offered the opportunity to cast provisional ballots, as occurred in the 2004 elections.

Nationally, AALDEF will mobilize approximately **500** volunteers to cover **150** poll sites in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland, where Asian language assistance is provided, where Asian American voter registration has increased, or where Asian American voters historically have experienced intimidation. AALDEF will document incidents of voter discrimination at poll sites and via its **toll-free hotline, 800.966.5946**, and conduct a multilingual exit poll of Asian American voters in all eight states.

AALDEF is partnering with several groups to mobilize volunteer attorneys, law students, college students and community activists on Election Day.
