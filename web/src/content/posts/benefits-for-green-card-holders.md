As a Green Card Holder, “Legal Permanent Resident”, you may be able to receive
many public benefits from New York State and the Federal Government. In some
cases, you are entitled to receive these benefits under some circumstances
without residency or work requirements. For other public benefits, there may be
income requirements, which you must meet in order to receive the benefit.
