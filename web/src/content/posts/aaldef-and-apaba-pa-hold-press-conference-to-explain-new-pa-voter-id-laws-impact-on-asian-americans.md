Philadelphia, PA — The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Pennsylvania (APABA-PA), in partnership with the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC), announced today that they will be hosting a press conference to educate the Asian American community and its leaders about requirements imposed by the new Pennsylvania Voter ID law. The press conference will take place on **July 2, 2012 at 12 noon** at the PCDC office, located at **301 N. 9th Street** in Philadelphia’s Chinatown.

“Voter ID laws like the new Pennsylvania law have consistently disenfranchised Asian American voters,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of the Democracy Program at AALDEF. “Asian Americans have been asked to show identification at disproportionately high rates even when it was not a legal requirement. Asian Americans are the fastest growing population in the U.S., and it is imperative that we educate the community about the new voter ID law to ensure that we can exercise our right to vote.”

Pennsylvania is the 16th state with a photo-ID requirement for voting. Governor Corbett signed the legislation on March 14, 2012.

Confirmed speakers include: Commissioner **Stephanie Singer**, Philadelphia City Commission Chair; **Glenn Magpantay**, Democracy Program Director, AALDEF; **Jennifer Lin**, President, APABA-PA; and **John Chin**, Executive Director, PCDC.

The press conference will cover:

* how this new law affects Asian Americans;
* acceptable forms of ID on Election Day;
* how to obtain free photo ID to vote;
* voters’ rights on Election Day; and 
* what to do if voters encounter any issues.

AALDEF, APABA-PA, and PCDC strongly encourage members of the ethnic press and concerned members of the community to attend.
