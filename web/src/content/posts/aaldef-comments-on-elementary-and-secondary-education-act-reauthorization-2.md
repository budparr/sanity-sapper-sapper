Today, AALDEF submitted comments on the Obama Administration’s proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  In response to the [administration’s “blueprint” for the ESEA][1], AALDEF outlined specific provisions that if included would improve public school education and increase resources for the most vulnerable students, espcially English Language Learners.  The comments were submitted to the the Committee on Education and Labor in the US House of Representatives.
