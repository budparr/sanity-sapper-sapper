New York Magazine — DNAinfo [says](https://www.dnainfo.com/20120426/lower-east-side-east-village/former-spitzers-corner-worker-sues-restaurant) Edward Kim, who worked in the [Spitzer’s Corner](https://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/spitzers-corner/) kitchen for roughly ten months, is suing the Lower East Side spot for allegedly paying him a “poverty wage.” Kim says he stuck around because he was promised a culinary education, in addition to the low pay. Instead, Kim says he was stuck doing menial tasks: “Now I realize they exploited me to get basic kitchen labor for next to nothing, for as long as they could … I feel like they’ve set me back on my dreams.” Ten months _is_ a long time to spend chopping garlic. \[[DNAinfo](https://www.dnainfo.com/20120426/lower-east-side-east-village/former-spitzers-corner-worker-sues-restaurant)\]
