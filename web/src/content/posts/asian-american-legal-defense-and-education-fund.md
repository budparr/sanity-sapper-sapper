The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) has launched a new
Youth Law Project offering resources and legal representation to Asian youth and
youth groups.

**What issues do we focus on?**

* Fair treatment in public education, including:
  * Discrimination by school officials
  * School discipline suspensions and expulsions
  * Truancy issues
  * School safety
  * Recent public education reforms and their impact on Asian and immigrant youth
* Hate crimes/racial targetingâ€”especially post-9/11 targeting of South Asians/Muslims
  * Hate crimes and racial targeting against Asian youth by other youth and community members
  * Racial targeting of Asian youth by police, school officials, or other authorities
* Juvenile justice and police misconduct
  * Police profiling of South Asian and Muslim youth
  * Police in schools and referrals from school discipline matters into juvenile hall
* Language access
  * Bilingual education and student access to services
  * Parent access to information and services

**What can we do for youth groups?**

We want to work in partnership with youth groups in youth organizing and social
change work by offering research, training, and other support.

* Presentations and trainings for youth members on subjects like:
  * Civil rights, due process, other legal rights
  * Policy advocacy and community organizing campaigns
  * Current social issues affecting the Asian American community
  * Presentations for staff and parents on legal rights of youth and parents
  * Research and strategy advice on community organizing campaigns
  * Collaborate on youth-run peer outreach and educational presentations on civil rights issues

**What can we do for youth in New York City?**

In addition to our work in partnership with youth groups, we offer the following services and programs for individual youth:

* Legal representation in public school hearings or principal conferences (Kindergarten through 12th grade)
* Volunteer opportunities with AALDEF in projects to promote civil rights and social change (9th grade through college)
