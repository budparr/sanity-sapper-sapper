**The Pennsylvania Asian American Vote 2006**

In the November 2006 midterm elections almost 300 Asian American voters in Philadelphias Chinatown, North Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, University City, and Upper Darby were surveyed as part of AALDEFs national multilingual exit poll. The exit poll—the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind in the nation—was conducted in 23 cities in nine states.

At this special presentation, comparative information will be given about Asian American voting patterns, attitudes on immigration reform, important issues for the 2008 Presidential elections, first-time voters, party enrollment, English proficiency and voting barriers.
