**COALITION EXRESSES OUTRAGE TO 92.3FREEFM AND CBS RADIO OVER RACIST AND SEXIST PROGRAMMING**

May 4, 2007 — Representatives from numerous organizations met with 92.3FreeFM and CBS Radio to demand the termination of DJs Jeff Vandergrift and Dan Lay and the producer of The Dog House with JV & Elvis. The controversy stems from the racist and sexist segment aired first on April 5 and then on April 19 of a prank phone call to a Chinese restaurant.

Specifically, the caller begins by telling the first restaurant employee, I would like some Asian food, son of a bitch as well as to the second employee, I would love to have lots of Asian food, son of a bitch. The caller then tells the restaurants female employee, Should I come to your restaurant so I can see you naked? and continues, That way, I can see your hot Asian spicy ass. As the caller goes on, he tells yet another employee that he would like some flied lice, but not some old dung, refers to his egg roll in your pants, and indicates that I am training in Kung Fu, bitch before ending with Tell that hot Asian girl answering the telephone, Id like to tap her ass.

Since the initial outcry by Asian American communities over the radio segment, Jeff Vandergrift and Dan Lay have been suspended without pay. However, re-runs highlighted as The Best of JV & Elvis: The Dog House were still airing, adding fuel to the flame. CBS Radio pulled the highlights as of Monday, May 7.

Comments Vicki Shu Smolin, President, OCA-NY, The meeting was productive. We are hopeful that CBS Radio will take action soon to address the community outcry. Our demands remain the same. We want the DJs and the producer fired.

Petitions have been circulating on-line and in communities across the country, echoing these demands. OCA-Westchester President, Jeannette Wang, has collected over 1000 signatures in just two days. We will continue to have people sign the petition demanding the DJs and producer be fired. We will continue to call upon the Asian American community who are also shareholders of CBS advertisers to apply pressure.

Marketers who advertise on networks that promote racism, hatred, and sexism need to know that their marketing dollars enable shock-jocks to demean communities that are unable to adequately defend themselves,” said Bill Imada, former president of the Asian American Advertising Federation. “Community-minded marketers such as Anheuser-Busch are no longer advertising on the JV and Elvis program, and more will follow their lead.”

In the meeting, that lasted just over an hour, representatives from OCA-New York, OCA-New Jersey, OCA-Westchester/Hudson Valley, OCA-Long Island, Asian American Advertising Federation, Families with Children from China, Asian Americans for Equality, Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Falloutcentral.com, Japanese American Citizens League, Korean American League for Civic Action, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Anti-Defamation League each voiced their objections over this segments use of negative stereotypes to increase ratings.

The coalition is growing beyond the Asian American community. The coalition intends to follow up on offers of support from African American, Latino and womens organizations.
