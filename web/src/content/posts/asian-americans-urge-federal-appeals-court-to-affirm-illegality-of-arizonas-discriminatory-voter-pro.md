The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), with pro bono
co-counsel Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, filed an _amicus_ “friend of the
court” brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in _Gonzalez v.
Arizona_, challenging the legality of Proposition 200, Arizona’s restrictive
voter proof of citizenship law passed in 2004.

On October 26, 2010, a three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit struck down the
law, finding the requirement that new voters present proof of United States
citizenship violated the National Voter Registration Act. (_Gonzalez v.
Arizona_, 624 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010)) On April 27, 2011, the Court granted a
re-hearing _en banc_, with the full Ninth Circuit considering the case.
Argument is scheduled for June 20.

The _amicus_ brief contends that Proposition 200 violates the National Voter
Registration Act (NVRA).  Congress enacted the NVRA to promote voter
registration and to eliminate state-imposed voting requirements because they
“disproportionately harmed voter participation by various groups including
racial minorities.”

Proposition 200 mandates a burdensome and unequal voting requirement on
non-citizens.  While native-born citizens may mail copies of their U.S. birth
certificates with their voter registration applications, naturalized citizens do
not have the same option and may only provide naturalization certificates in
person, not by mail.

Asian Americans are disproportionately affected by proof of citizenship
requirements because a high percentage of them are naturalized citizens. Of the
approximately 126,497 Asian Americans living in Arizona, 51,370 are foreign-born
naturalized citizens. Potentially 40% of the Asian American community may
encounter the barriers of Proposition 200 when attempting to register to vote.
By contrast, only 3.5% of White Americans are foreign-born naturalized citizens,
with few burdened by Proposition 200.

Glenn D. Magpantay, AALDEF Democracy Program director, said, “All eligible
citizens, either naturalized or native-born, should have equal access to the
electoral process.  The barriers naturalized citizens encounter as a result of
Proposition 200 run contrary to the  NVRA, which seeks to eliminate such
barriers to voting.”
