On February 26, 2016, a coalition of 82 civil rights, voting rights, labor, religious, environmental, and education groups, including AALDEF, wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, urging the Senate to hold hearings and consider the president’s nominee to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the responsibility of the Senate to evaluate the nominees’ fitness and qualifications under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
