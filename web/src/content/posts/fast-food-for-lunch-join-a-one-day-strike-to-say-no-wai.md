I just came back from Asia, so I have Asia on the mind. What do you know–on Monday night football, there was the NY Giants’ Justin Tuck doing the prayer-bow Thai move after sacking RGIII.

I know the move well. I saw Ronald McDonald doing the move in Patong Beach, Phuket.

Fast food is a multinational corporate phenomenon, to my dismay. I certainly didn’t patronize Ronald abroad. Not even his new Thai bubble drink.

Street food and a fresh coconut was plenty fast enough for me.

In Thailand the average income is $4,000 a year. Fast-food pay may make sense there. But not in the U.S., where some individuals and families are trying to make it on $8.25 an hour–part-time.

I’ll have more to say on income inequality in a later post.

But for now, there’s a massive [one-day boycott](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/business/economy/wage-strikes-planned-at-fast-food-outlets-in-100-cities.html?_r=0) scheduled for today to push for a more livable wage for workers here in the U.S.

The call is enough to lose your appetite for a day–at least.
