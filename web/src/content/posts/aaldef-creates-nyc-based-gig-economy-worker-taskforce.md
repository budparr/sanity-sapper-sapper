The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) today announced that it is creating a Gig-Economy Taskforce to focus on problems facing workers in the gig-economy, The Taskforce will focus on problems facing workers in the gig-economy, including wage theft, digital isolation, misclassification, forced arbitration, and lack of benefits.

AALDEF Skadden Fellow Audrey Winn, who is leading this project, said: "Starting in January of 2018, we will begin holding a monthly meeting on the third Tuesday of each month, and curating a mailing list to allow advocates and activists to collaborate, ask questions, and share strategies for advocating for the rights of gig-workers."

She added, "As we grow, we hope to become a place for innovative legal and organizing trainings, and a community that is active in shaping the future of contingent work. In an uneven playing field, our ultimate goal is to help amplify the voices of workers, so that they can be heard over the sound of billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of venture capital."

Winn said that she will be working on the Taskforce with Mel Gonzalez, an Equal Justice Works Fellow at Make The Road. They plan to build a support network for advocates and activists addressing the full range of issues affecting the rights of gig-workers.

Her colleague, Mel Gonzalez, is an Equal Justice Works Fellow at Make the Road, working on a project supporting immigrant delivery drivers in the gig economy.
