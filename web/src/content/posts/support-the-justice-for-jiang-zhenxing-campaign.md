Dear Friends,

We are asking for your support for the **Justice for Jiang Zhenxing Campaign**.

The Justice for Jiang Zhenxing Campaign believes that every human being is entitled to human rights and that current current Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practices have shown utter disregard for those rights. We demand full accountability from ICE regarding the Jiang case. We support immigration reforms that help families efforts to reunite and stay together, and we oppose the anti-immigrant legislation now being considered in Congress.

On behalf of the Justice for Jiang Zhenxing Campaign,

Jimmy Chang, Philadelphia Hoyu Chinese American Association

Ellen Somekawa, Asian Americans United
