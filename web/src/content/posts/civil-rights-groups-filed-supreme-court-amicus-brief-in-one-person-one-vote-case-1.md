The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, together with the Asian
American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and five other civil rights
groups, filed an _amicus_ brief in the Supreme Court in _Evenwel v. Abbott_, a
challenge to the “one person, one vote” principle that legislative districts
should be drawn based on the total number of people who live within them. The
Evenwel  appellants seek to conduct Texas state redistricting using a metric
other than total population, such as citizen voting age residents, registered
voters, or actual voters.

The _amicus_ brief examines potential discriminatory effects that the  Evenwel
proposals would have on language minorities, communities of color, youth,
immigrant communities, people with disabilities, and other underrepresented
people. AALDEF highlighted the fact that many Asian American voters face
language barriers, intimidation at the polls, and [discrimination throughout the
voting process](/uploads/pdf/2014AccessToDemocracyReport.pdf)–factors that
restrict the numbers of naturalized citizens who register to vote and actually
vote. Using metrics such as citizen voting age population would mean that 50-67%
of the Asian American population would not be counted in the redistricting
process.

“The _Evenwel_ appellants seek to take our country back to a time when certain
people literally did not count. They would prefer to ignore recent demographic
trends and have a select few speak for the uncounted masses. The data shows that
native-born whites would benefit, while Asian Americans and other language
minorities, immigrants, and people of color would be adversely affected. The
Supreme Court should reaffirm the lower court ruling and strike down the
_Evenwel_ appellants’ thinly veiled attempt to disenfranchise millions of
people,” said Jerry Vattamala, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program.
