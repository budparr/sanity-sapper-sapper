The speakers sat before a backdrop of two Chinese screens that bore the characters for “double happiness,” but no one looked very cheery.

At a Wednesday news conference, Asian leaders responded with doubt to the new programming planned for troubled South Philadelphia High School, where 30 Asian students were attacked on Dec. 3.

They spoke the day after Superintendent Arlene Ackerman announced a series of initiatives, including a program run by Asian Arts Initiative, an in-school center for new immigrants, and classes offering Chinese language instruction. She also said the school would get an Asian assistant principal.

“What we don’t want to see is a lot of broad proclamations and programs … without a significant dialogue with the community,” said Helen Gym, a board member of Asian Americans United.

District officials had no immediate comment.

The news conference, held at Joy Tsin Lau restaurant in Chinatown, included several Asian student leaders.

Bach Tong, a rising junior who recently transferred, said problems at the school were not all the result of student-on-student harassment or violence.

“It’s about the adults,” he said, “who are supposed to stand up and take responsibility.”

Cecilia Chen, an attorney with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, noted that Ackerman had stressed zero tolerance for harassment and violence during the new school year.

“Disciplining perpetrators should not be the only solution,” Chen said. For instance, she said, classes in multiracial history could help students understand their peers’ experience and background.

A reporter asked Gym if the new programs would help change the school.

“That’s the question,” she answered. “It’s great to do an after-school arts program, but will it address racial violence and harassment?”
