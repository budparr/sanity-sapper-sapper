Save the date:  On Thursday, August 12, the Asian Pacific American Lawyers Association of New Jersey (APALA/NJ) sponsors its 5th annual Golf Classic and Dinner at the Wild Turkey Golf Club, Hamburg, NJ 07419.  A portion of the proceeds will support AALDEF’s New Jersey-Asian American Legal Project, which addresses the legal needs and civil rights concerns of New Jersey’s fast-growing Asian American communities.  Since its inception, NJ-AALP has assisted thousands of Asian Americans through legal clinics and educational presentations. NJ-AALP’s cases include challenges to workplace exploitation, job discrimination, school bullying and harassment, police misconduct and First Amendment retaliation.
