New York—**Robert T. Matsui**, a 14-term Congressman from Sacramento, California, passed away on January 1 after a brief illness. Rep. Matsui, 63, was head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and one of the highest-ranking Democrats in the House. A former AALDEF Justice in Action honoree, AALDEF had the honor of working with Rep. Matsui on Japanese American redress and many other issues of importance to the Asian American community over more than two decades.

“Congressman Matsui was an inspring role model for many Asian American lawyers who wanted to use the legislative process to promote social change,” said Margaret Fung, AALDEF Executive Director. “He and his staff on Capitol Hill were very helpful on issues ranging from opposing hate violence to promoting immigration reform, and we will miss his wise counsel.”

“Our sincere condolences go out to the Matsui family,” said Harsha Murthy, AALDEF Board President. “We encourage AALDEF members and others to make a contribution in his memory to The Matsui Foundation for Public Service at P.O. Box 1347, Sacramento, CA 95812, and send a condolence note to his wife Doris and family at <mailto:ca05.condolences@mail.house.gov>.”
