#### Station Issues On-Air Apology; Commits to Taking Proactive Steps to Increase Cultural Awareness and Understanding

The New Jersey/National Taskforce Against Hate Media and the New Jersey Coalition for Asian American Civil Rights announces that a mutual understanding has been reached with New Jersey 101.5 FM and parent corporation Millennium Central New Jersey regarding the April 25th broadcast by Craig Carton and Ray Rossi (“The Jersey Guys”), which included disparaging comments and characterizations of Asian and Arab American communities.

As part of this mutual understanding, Carton and Rossi issued an on-air apology on behalf of themselves, Millennium Central New Jersey, and NJ 101.5 FM during their afternoon drive-time show on May 25th. Carton and Rossi acknowledged that a portion of the April 25th broadcast had been offensive and insensitive, particularly to members of the Asian American community.

In addition, the Station has agreed to several long-term objectives and strategies to enhance cultural understanding and awareness among their staff and their listening audience including:

1. Issuance of a public statement that will be available on their website.
2. Refresher cultural diversity and competency training for their entire management team, on-air staff, program directors, producers and phone screeners.
3. Stronger policy against racially derogatory speech.
4. On-air promotion of events within New Jersey concerning the Asian American community. As part of these efforts, the Station will assist in the promotion of the dedication of a memorial event on Saturday, May 28th, 2005 at 11AM in Veterans Park in River Vale, New Jersey to honor Min Soo Choi, an Asian American soldier who served and died in Iraq.

“We are encouraged by the outcome in this matter and by Millennium Central New Jersey’s ongoing commitment to ensure greater ethnic understanding and awareness,” said Veronica S. Jung of the Coalition. “We look forward to working with representatives of the station and company to implement the long-term objectives.”

The New Jersey/National Taskforce Against Hate Media and the New Jersey Coalition for Asian American Civil Rights undertook a month-long campaign to respond to the derogatory statements that were made on the April 25th broadcast. “These included statements that characterized Arabs and Asians as “foreigners” and “fringe groups” who “should never dictate the outcome of an American election,” explained Hesham Mahmoud of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee of New Jersey.

“Portions of the April 25th broadcast sent a clear message to Asian communities: that we are ‘un-American’ and foreigners. We hope to work together with the Station and other allies to ensure that such incidents do not recur,” said Deepa Iyer of South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow (SAALT).

“We hope that in the future, the station will be more sensitive to broadcasts that undoubtedly reach a large number of listeners- including children who are still impressionable,” explained Terry Yang of the Asian Pacific American Lawyers Association of New Jersey.

Over the past month, the members of the diverse Coalition—which includes groups such as the Organization of Chinese Americans (New Jersey chapter), the New Jersey Chinese American Federation, the Korean American Lawyers Association of Greater New York, the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee of New Jersey, the Coalition Against Hate Media, and the South Asian Bar Association of New Jersey—as well as community members in New Jersey and around the country, have worked together to bring attention to the impact of the April 25th broadcast. These efforts have included a face to face meeting with station representatives, advocacy towards advertisers and sponsors of the Carton and Rossi show, and letter-writing campaigns.

“The strength of the coalition that formed to respond to this incident is its diversity,” said Dennis Chin, a student at The College of New Jersey and a member of the National Asian American Student Conference (NAASCon). “Through our continued collaboration with the Station, we hope to bring about greater cultural understanding of the ethnic communities that comprise the fabric of New Jersey and our country.”
