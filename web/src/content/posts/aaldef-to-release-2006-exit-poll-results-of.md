AALDEF's multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. Nearly 11,000 Asian American voters in eight states and 3,000 in four states were surveyed in the 2004 and 2002 exit polls, respectively. More than 30 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans.

Co-sponsors of the April 9 and 10 presentations include the ACA/Organization of Chinese Americans Detroit Chapter, ACCESS Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, Asian American Center for Justice/American Citizens for Justice, Asian Pacific American Law Student Association at the University of Michigan, APIA Vote Michigan, Center for Civic Participation, Michigan Asian Pacific American Bar Association, the Michigan Election Law Project, and the Michigan Journal of Race and Law.
