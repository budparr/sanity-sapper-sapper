In response to President Obama’s announcement about the provision of administrative relief to certain groups of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) has issued new fact sheets summarizing these programs. They include the expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and a new Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which provides eligible immigrants who have U.S. citizen or permanent resident sons and daughters temporary relief from deportation and allows them to apply for work authorization.

As with the original DACA program, however, DAPA and the expansion of DACA do not provide a path to permanent resident (“green card”) status or citizenship. For more information on the new DAPA and expanded DACA programs, see AALDEF’s Frequently Asked Questions on “[Deferred Action for Parental Accountability and Expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Programs](/press-release/new-faqs-for-expanded-daca-applications---feb-18/).” (rev. 2/18/15)

While we wait for detailed guidance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on the process for applying for deferred action under these two programs, it is important for individuals who may qualify under DACA or DAPA to consult with immigration attorneys and to begin collecting documents that they will need in order to apply. We believe that the list of “[Useful Documents to Prepare for Expanded Deferred Action Applications](/press-release/documents-for-expanded-deferred-action-applications/),” posted on AALDEF’s website, which can be used to prove identity, presence and continuous residence in the U.S., and family ties to U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, will be helpful in preparing supporting documents.

Please note that individuals seeking DAPA or DACA status from USCIS cannot file their applications until February 2015 for the expanded DACA and May 2015 for DAPA. However, those who are eligible under the original DACA program can continue to file initial or renewal applications (see [DACA Fact Sheet](/uploads/pdf/DACAFactSheet8.27.15-final.pdf) and [FAQs on DACA renewals](/press-release/faq-about-renewals-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca/)).

Be wary of individuals claiming that they can file your DAPA or expanded DACA case now and ask you to pay fees. It is best to seek the advice of a qualified immigration lawyer or an accredited representative about your case.
