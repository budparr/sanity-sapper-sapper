Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 639 Asian and Arab American voters in Michigan in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that Asian and Arab Americans backed President Obama and Democratic candidates by a wide margin, and a majority supported comprehensive immigration reform across party lines.

86% of Asian and Arab Americans polled in Michigan voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. Of those surveyed, 58% were enrolled in the Democratic party, while only 7% were enrolled in the Republican party, and 33% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party.

The major factors influencing the Asian and Arab American vote in Michigan were economy/jobs (52%), health care (37%), education (34%), and civil rights/immigrants rights (31%). The majority of Asian and Arab Americans (62%) in Michigan supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.

“Arab and Asian American voters are a growing part of the Michigan electorate, with more than 1 in 4 surveyed indicating they were first time voters,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “In Hamtramck, where there is a large Bangladeshi American population, 40% of those surveyed were first-time voters.”

Notably, due to its significant Bangladeshi American voting population, in October of 2011 Hamtramck, MI became the first city in the U.S. to be covered under the Language Assistance Provisions (Section 203) of the federal Voting Rights Act for Bangladeshi voters.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/) Asian and Arab American voters in jurisdictions with large Asian American populations. In Michigan, the exit poll was conducted in eight cities: Ann Arbor, Canton, Dearborn, Detroit, Gaines, Hamtramck, Novi, and Troy. The largest Asian ethnic groups polled were Bangladeshi (34%), Asian Indian (20%), Chinese (18%), Arab (14%), and Korean (3%).

Glenn Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 multilingual exit poll in Detroit, Michigan. Key findings include the following:

* **The majority of Asian and Arab Americans in Michigan voted for President Obama.**

Support for President Obama was consistent across all categories, including first-time (89%), foreign- (87%) and native-born (84%), limited English proficient (89%) and English proficient (86%) voters, and voters of all age groups. Of the 33% of Asian and Arab Americans in Michigan who were not enrolled in any political party, 83% voted for Obama, while 12% voted for Romney.

* **The majority of Asian and Arab Americans in Michigan supported the Democratic candidate for Congress.**

81% voted for Democratic U.S. Senator Debbie Ann Stabenow, and 12% for Republican candidate Pete Hoekstra.

In addition, 68% of Asian and Arab Americans surveyed voted for Syed Taj (D), although Kerry Bentivolio (R) won by 51% of the overall vote.
