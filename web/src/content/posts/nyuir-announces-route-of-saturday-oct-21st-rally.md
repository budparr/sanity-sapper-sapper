Representatives of **New York United for Immigrant Rights (NYUIR)**—a coalition of more than 60 immigrant and human rights organizations in the New York metro area—announced today the details and route of its Sat. October 21st Rally and March to demand **“NO DEAL: FULL LEGALIZATION NOW!”** NYUIR announced:

A **1 p.m. rally** at Union Square featuring speakers from affected communities and their supporters.

At **3:30 p.m.**, protesters will then march along 15th Street to 6th Avenue, and proceed to Times Square carrying a **“Border Wall of Remembrance and Resistance”** to commemorate the people who are suffering under current immigration laws and funeral coffins to signify the death threat they pose to our rights.

At approximately **4:30 p.m.** the procession will arrive at Times Square.

Immigrant leaders, affected community members from the New York metropolitan area, and representatives of the faith community described their outreach efforts for the rally, and called on their communities today to participate. The speakers were: Monami Maulik of Desis Rising Up & Moving/Immigrant Communities in Action, Brother Joel Magallan of Asociación Tepeyac, Father Luis Barrios of San Romero Church, Rafaela Lozano of Families for Freedom, Carolyn de Leon of CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, Manuel Castro of the Latin American Integration Center, Rafael Samanez of Esperanza del Barrio, Bernadette Ellorin of Philippine Forum/May 1st Coalition, Alix Nguefack of American Friends Services Committee, Raquel Batista of the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights, and Panama Vicente Alba of LIUNA Local 108/May 1st.

On Saturday, Oct. 21st, the immigrant rights movement in New York will declare the beginning of **“Round Two”** of our communities response to Congress failure to propose and pass a full, fair, and humane legalization bill. Instead, Homeland Security has stepped up its campaign of fear and disappearances through workplace raids and deportations.

The attack on workers rights and immigrants rights reached a new low in Congress this fall. Last month, both Houses passed, and the President recently signed, legislation for a **$6 billion wall** at the U.S.-Mexico bordercertain to add to the **death toll of 4,000-plus children, women, and men** in the desert. Instead of recognizing and addressing the systemic failures of 20 years of immigration policy, Congressional leaders availed themselves of racist immigration politics in order to avoid their responsibility to formulate real immigration policy.

Leaders, residents, and advocates will invite everyone in the New York metro area to join our campaign for human rights and the soul of American democracy.
