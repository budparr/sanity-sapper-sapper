The **Massachusetts Superior Court** has upheld an earlier decision by the American Arbitration Association ordering three veteran Lowell school teachers reinstated with full back pay, seniority, and benefits.

On Nov. 30, Justice Christine McEvoy ordered the Lowell School Committee to immediately comply with all provisions of the award. In 2003, school administrators had singled out non-native English speaking educators to take English fluency tests, and dismissed them for allegedly failing the tests.

Vandy Duch, Vong Oung, and Pedro Espada were represented by AALDEF and co-counsel Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP. To read background on the case, please click [here][1].
