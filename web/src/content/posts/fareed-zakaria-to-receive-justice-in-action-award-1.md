Other honorees are **Parkin Lee**, Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Secretary of The Rockefeller Group and Yale Law professor **Jean Koh Peters.**

The co-emcees for the evening are **Juju Chang**, Emmy Award-winning correspondent for ABC News _Nightline_, and **Sree Sreenivasan**, Dean of Student Affairs and digital media professor at Columbia Journalism School.

The AALDEF Justice in Action Awards recognize exceptional individuals for their outstanding achievements and contributions in advancing justice and equality. Past recipients include the late civil rights icon Fred Korematsu, David Henry Hwang, Harold Koh, Mira Nair, Deval Patrick, Salman Rushdie, Seymour Hersh, Charles Ogletree, Jr., Nicholas Kristof, Sheryl Wu Dunn, Harry Belafonte, Margaret Cho, and Yoko Ono.

Over 600 leaders of the civil rights, legal, business, and arts communities are expected to attend AALDEF's 2012 Lunar New Year Gala celebrating the Year of the Dragon. The Gala begins with a 6 p.m. cocktail reception and silent auction, followed by the Justice in Action Awards ceremony and a banquet dinner. 

Since 1974, AALDEF has been protecting and promoting the civil rights of Asian Americans across the nation through litigation, advocacy, organizing, and community education. All proceeds from the Lunar New Year Gala will go directly towards supporting AALDEF's legal and educational programs in immigrant rights, economic justice for workers, voting rights and civic participation, affirmative action, language access to services, youth rights and educational equity, housing and environmental justice, Census policy, and the elimination of hate violence, police misconduct, and human trafficking.
