AALDEF has filed an _amicus_ brief in support of a petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court of a case involving _Miranda_ warnings and the knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to remain silent by a young immigrant, Naif Al-Yousif.

In 2001, the Denver police arrested Naif Al-Yousif, a Saudi Arabian national with limited English proficiency who was 22 years old at the time. Officers read him his Miranda rights in a rapid-fire, eighteen-second string of words. After a mumbled affirmative response from Al-Yousif, the officers questioned him and obtained a number of incriminating statements. Later the same day, a different officer repeated the Miranda warnings, this time taking care to ascertain that Al-Yousif understood each one. Al-Yousif immediately requested an attorney.

The appeal questions whether Al-Yousif knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. The case calls to the Courtâ€™s attention important questions of whether the promise of _Miranda_ applies to everyone, regardless of language ability or cultural background. Jones Day was pro bono counsel on this case.
