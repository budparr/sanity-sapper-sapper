"We are happy to announce the beginning of the New Jersey Asian American Legal Project's fall clinics in Jersey City," said NJ-AALP Director Alex Saingchin, an Equal Justice Works Fellow with AALDEF. "Many times, Asian Americans do not know where to turn to for reliable information about immigration law, or what to do if their employer is unfairly denying them minimum wage and overtime. We look forward to meeting the needs and concerns of Filipino Americans with respect to immigration and employment law, as we continue to provide vital legal advice to the community for free."

AALP has hosted several clinics in the Asian American community in Jersey City over the past two years. With help from several Asian American community organizations, there has been a tremendous turnout from the community at each of the clinics.
