As of May 31, 2005, all applications to renew or replace a green card must be mailed to and filed with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) located in Los Angles where all such applications are now processed. The mailing addresses for USCIS in Los Angeles are listed on the back page. In New Jersey, you can no longer drop by an Application Service Center (ASC) without an appointment to renew a green card. USCIS will send you an appointment date to visit an ASC. If you live in northern New Jersey, you will be fingerprinted at an ASC in Newark or Hackensack. The locations are listed on the back page. If you live in southern New Jersey, your fingerprinting will be done at the closer USCIS District Office located in Philadelphia, or at an ASC in northern New Jersey designated by USCIS. The appointment letter will give you the ACS location. You may also use the USCIS website listed below to file your application and request an appointment. If you are ineligible for electronic filing, you must mail a completed I-90 Form Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (green card) to the USCIS in Los Angeles. This form can be obtained and printed from the website at www.uscis.gov or from USCIS at 1-800-870-3676. You should mail the following:

1. A completed I-90 Form;
2. A check or money order for $ 365.00 for the filing fee and another check or money order for $ 85.00 for fingerprinting; Make them payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security;
3. A copy of expiring green card (both sides) if available; and
4. Identification such as drivers license, passport, or a state issued identification card with a picture of you. (Mail copies only.)

On their appointment date, applicants who have changed their names from the names on their green cards must bring original documents or records such as a marriage certificate, court order, or divorce decree with them to the ASC. Translated documents and records must be certified. (Mail only copies.)

You can mail your completed I-90 through the United States Postal Service or through a private courier service.

Mail through U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for delivery to:  
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  
P.O. Box 54870  
Los Angeles, CA 90054-0870

Or mail through non-USPS for private courier delivery to:  
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  
Attention: I-90

La Mirada, CA 90638

In your appointment letter, you will be assigned a location for fingerprinting and an interview. If you live in northern New Jersey, you will be assigned either:
