AALDEF seeks volunteers to defend Asian American voting rights in the November
2017 elections in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia.

In past elections, Asian Americans have faced a series of barriers in exercising
their right to vote, including segregated “Asian” voting lines. When the news
media reported on election results, Asian Americans were overlooked. On November
7, 2017, AALDEF, along with other Asian American groups, will again be
monitoring the elections and conducting non-partisan voter surveys at poll sites
in Asian American neighborhoods.

We need your help. Sign up now at [https://www.aaldef.net](https://www.aaldef.net).

Attendance at one 60-minute training session is required for all volunteers. All
volunteers must be non-partisan and work a 3-hour shift. Asian language ability
is helpful, but not required. (CLE trainings are 90 minutes. Attorneys can
receive 1.5 CLE credits including 0.5 ethics credit.)

For more information, contact AALDEF Democracy Program Director Jerry Vattamala
or Voting Rights Organizer Iris Zalun at 800-966-5946 or
votingrights@aaldef.org.
