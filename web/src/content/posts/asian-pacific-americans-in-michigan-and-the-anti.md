#### A Toolkit for Grassroots Leaders

The **anti-affirmative action ballot Proposal 2**, proposed by out-of-state California businessmen, received a No vote of 42% and a Yes vote of 58% among all Michigan voters on Tuesday, Nov. 9th. But three in four of approximately 300 Asian American and Arab American voters AALDEF surveyed voted down Proposal 2.

Proposal 2 seeks to roll back progress for Michigans women and people of color. The proposal aims to eliminate affirmative action and outreach programs that target race, gender, ethnicity, color or national origin in public education, public employment and public contracting.

The **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund** and **One United Michigan**â€˜s toolkit is designed to serve as a resource to both Asian Pacific American and non-Asian Pacific American leaders in Michigan as they educate various communities throughout the state about the likely impact that the 2006 anti-affirmative action Michigan ballot proposal would have on Asian Pacific Americans.

Oftentimes, there are misconceptions about how Asian Pacific Americans fit into the issue of affirmative action; this can serve as a guide to those that are uncertain about how to answer those questions.

Our toolkit includes statistics and arguments related to Asian Pacific Americans and affirmative action, specifically related to fields such as employment, contracting, and health.

We also know that each Asian Pacific American ethnicity has its own characteristics and community needs; therefore, relevant statistics and arguments were needed for South Asian, Southeast Asian, and other Asian Pacific American ethnic groups.
