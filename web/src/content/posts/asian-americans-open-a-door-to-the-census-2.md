On Wednesday, May 26 in Fairfax, Virginia and Washington, DC, the Asian American
Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), joined by Census Director Robert
Groves and several Asian American community leaders, hosted two press
conferences to bring awareness to the Census Bureau’s Non-Response Follow-up
Phase, or door-to-door canvassing operations.  Across the nation, census-takers
have been canvassing neighborhoods to follow up with households that did not
return their census forms by mail.  This phase of the census, which began on May
1, is expected to last no later than early July.

As of April 28, the national participation response rate was 72%.  The response
rate for the District of Columbia was 69%, trailing the national rate by 3%.
The State of Virginia’s response rate was 76%, surpassing the national rate by
4%.  Although the response rate in Fairfax County matched the state rate, many
Census tracts in areas with large concentrations of Asian Americans, such as
Annandale ( 69%), Bailey’s Crossroads ( 64%), Centreville ( 72%), Fairfax (
77%), Falls Church ( 77%), and Seven Corners ( 63%), were unable to match or
surpass their 2000 response rates.

During both press conferences, Glenn D. Magpantay, AALDEF Democracy Program
Director, literally opened a free standing door and said, “When the census comes
to your home, open the door.”  On the other side of the door were census
employees dressed as census-takers, carrying a white, government-issued
identification card and an official “U.S. Census Bureau” black shoulder bag.

Community leaders emphasized the importance of cooperating with census-takers,
the benefits of participation, and the confidentiality of census information.
Each speaker also tried to allay fears and address specific community concerns.
