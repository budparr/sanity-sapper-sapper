On **April 3, 2006**, immigrants facing deportation under the current laws, legal experts, and community leaders will speak against radically expanded deportation and detention provisions buried in the Senate proposal that is being widely hailed as a pro-immigration “legalization” bill.

While there are some good provisions in the Senate bill, including the ability of immigrant workers to adjust their status, it is fatally packed with egregious and unjust enforcement provisions that undercut the spirit and goals of real legalization. The bill, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 27, contains many of the same provisions of the enforcement-tilted bill that passed the House (H.R. 4437). These extreme provisions would effectively bar millions of people from even the chance to earn legalization, take away the right to a fair hearing, legalize the indefinite detention of noncitizens, allow domestic military bases to be used for immigration detention, and turn local police into immigration agents.

Current law on immigration enforcement is already very harsh. By giving more detention authority to immigration agents, this bill would undermine checks-and-balances in our immigration system and hurt our communities and families. A real comprehensive immigration bill that offers a just solution must strip these egregious provisions.

Former detainees, their families, asylees, and representatives of legal and community organizations will speak on Monday about the impact of these policies on our clients, our communities, our youth, and their families. A press kit will be provided. See below for more information on the actions taking place in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, and New York City.
