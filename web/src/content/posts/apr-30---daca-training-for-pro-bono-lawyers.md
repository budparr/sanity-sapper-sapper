A significant number of Asian immigrants are among an estimated 300,000 additional undocumented individuals who may benefit from an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Although applications were to be accepted beginning on February 18, 2015, a Texas federal court has temporarily halted the President’s executive immigration actions, including the expanded DACA program and a new deferred action initiative, known as DAPA, for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The Justice Department has appealed this ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

  DACA offers temporary relief from the threat of deportation to young people and allows them to obtain employment authorization. Last November, the Obama administration announced the expansion of DACA and the creation of a new DAPA  program, which was expected to begin in May 2015. For many such individuals, this will be the first opportunity to legally work and live in this country.

  The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) is seeking pro bono counsel to represent eligible people who qualify under these deferred action programs. No prior legal experience with DACA is required, but pro bono counsel will be required to attend a training prior to taking a case. Any cases handled pursuant to this training would also support the work of RAISE, a pan-Asian undocumented youth-led group affiliated with AALDEF. We are applying for CLE credit for this program.

  If you are interested in taking a DACA/DAPA case through AALDEF, please join us for the training on Thursday, April 30, 2015 at 6:30 pm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, 200 Liberty Street, Conference Room 40-F, New York, NY 10281. To register for the training, please email AALDEF at jlei@aaldef.org. Light dinner will be provided.
