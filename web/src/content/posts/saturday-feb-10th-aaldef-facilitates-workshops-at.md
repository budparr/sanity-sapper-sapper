AALDEF Staff Attorney **Khin Mai Aung** and Voting Rights Public Education Coordinator **Brian Redondo** will be facilitating workshops at this year’s ECAASU (East Coast Asian American Students Union) Conference on Saturday, February 10th.

A full workshop schedule is available at [https://www.ecaasu2007.org/workshops.htm](https://www.ecaasu2007.org/workshops.htm)

**Violence towards APAs in Education  
**1pm: William L. Harkness Hall (WLH) 003  
_Khin Mai Aung, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) Attorney_

Violence against Asian Americans dates back hundreds of years. In the new century, Asian Americans still face some of the same challenges, racism, and fear. A couple of years ago, a student in Boston was beaten to death simply because of his race. What can we, as college students, do to fight for these students right to live without fear? Join Khin Mai Aung, a lawyer from Asian American LegalDefense and Education Fund (AALDEF) to discuss current efforts to fight this issue.

**APA Voter Registration Drive–Why and How  
**1pm & 3pm: William L. Harkness Hall (WLH) 009  
_Christine Chen, Jeannette Moy, and Brian Redondo, APIA Vote; Eric Byler, filmmaker, will join at 3pm_

Who says Asian Americans have no political power? Casting stereotypes aside, Asian Americans have emerged as key players in the political arena as elected officials, campaign organizers, and uni-fied swing voters. In the 2006 elections, Asian American voters provided the winning votes in numerous close races, and thus changed the landscape of the U.S. Congress. This two-part interactive workshop seeks to show that Asian Americans are not apathetic and disjointed, but rather a unified force with rapidly growing political power. We will discuss everything from grassroots organizing to block voting to other issues important to our community. We will also provide participants with the skills to organize political power on their own campuses and to gear up for 2008! Come to Part 1 for a discussion of where we are as a community, and then return for Part 2 at 3pm to plan for where were going!

The **East Coast Asian American Students Union** conference is the premier Asian American collegiate conference in the United States.

Hosted from February 8th to February 10th, ECAASU 2007 will return to New Haven to commemorate its founding at Yale thirty years ago. Over 1,000 students will gather at Yale looking to improve intercollegiate communication and reach out to the greater Asian American community. ECAASU 2007 gives us the perfect opportunity to reflect on the growth of the last thirty years and envision the future of Asian America.
