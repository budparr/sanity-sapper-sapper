I wrote an essay about my mother that was in my collection of Emil Amok columns
in my book _Amok_ back in 2000.

I read it here, along with a preamble on the [podcast](https://bit.ly/2pGWoVg),
because I’ve too often given short shrift to my mom’s story, in favor of my
dad’s.

But my mother’s story was pretty incredible too. She survived the Japanese
occupation of Manila during WWII and found her way to the U.S. with the help of
an angel, a Spanish aristocrat who was unrelated, and whom I remember as having
so much makeup on her face that she she looked like a ghost. I only knew her as
Lola Angelita, world traveler.

My mom is in this picture, on the left. Another one of her comadres, my Lola
Rosie, is holding me. I’m just horribly disoriented looking for the right
nipple. And probably crying.

All that and more on the podcast for Mothers Day in May, which is also AAPI
Heritage Month.

Here’s a shoutout to _The New Yorker_ for its funny, satirical cover, the
positive yellowfacing of Dr. David Dao, who is replaced by the ousted FBI chief
James Comey.

It’s funny, not racist, as some have suggested. It’s a recognition of how we
felt about Dao, and how we should all feel about what’s happened to Comey.

In Trump-speak, the Comey thing is as important as the Russia thing, and so much
more important than any email thing.

In the firing, Trump as Nixon was pretty obvious from Day 1. But Trump doesn’t
leave well enough alone. He’s compounded it with subsequent steps that only
create a growing credibility gap between his White House and the American
public.

Where is the Truth about the firing of Comey? We have several versions, at this
point. One too many for a real democracy.

And if Trump isn’t getting really Nixony, why did he tweet about the possibility
that conversations with Comey were taped?

> James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before
> he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [May 12,
> 2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/863007411132649473")

So our democracy under Trump is getting shakier and shakier, especially when
Trump feels his people must be loyal to him and not the American people.

King Donald?

It leaves us with motherhood to hang on to for now, while we can.

My tribute to my Mom and all mothers on this [podcast](https://bit.ly/2pGWoVg).
