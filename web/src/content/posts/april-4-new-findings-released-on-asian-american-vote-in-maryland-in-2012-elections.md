On **Thursday, April 4 at 2pm** at the **University of Maryland, College Park**, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will release detailed findings on Asian American voters in Maryland in the 2012 elections.

AALDEF conducted a nonpartisan, multilingual exit poll of nearly 400 Asian American voters in Maryland, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. At this special presentation, comparative information will be given about the Asian American vote in the 2012 elections, including concerns about key issues and profiles of the Asian American vote by ethnicity, party enrollment, and English proficiency, as well as reports on voting barriers.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/) in cities with large Asian American populations. In Maryland, AALDEF conducted the exit poll in Rockville and Silver Spring, two cities with the largest Asian American populations, including Chinese American, Asian Indian, Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Filipino American. These results reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.

AALDEF Democracy Program Director Glenn Magpantay will present comparative information on the following topics covered in the 2012 exit poll, including:

* Vote for President and Congress
* Party enrollment and voting history
* Concerns about key issues
* Ethnicity and national origin
* English proficiency levels
* Citizenship tenure (duration)
* First-time voters
* Voting barriers
