At the Fred T. Korematsu Day celebration in San Francisco on Sunday, most of the
honorees had passed on and were represented by their scions.

But I managed to sit next to one of the originals, 98-year-old Mabel Fong.

If you’re Asian American, you likely know Korematsu — the man who fought the
U.S. government’s internment of Japanese Americans all the way to the Supreme
Court.

If you don’t know Fong, I don’t blame you.

I didn’t either until I sat next to her.

Fong was one of the members of the 1938 National Dollar Store strike in San
Francisco, a strike against sweatshop conditions and low wages for garment
workers in the city’s Chinatown.

The strike ended when white retail clerks at National Dollar refused to cross
the Chinese workers’ picket line. Not only were conditions improved in the
factories, but a racial barrier was broken in the city’s retail stores. Chinese
Americans like Fong got hired.

“Other white shops didn’t hire Asians,” Fong told me. “We organized the union
and went on strike and we all got hired in the white shops.”

Sitting next to her was daughter-in-law Karen Fong. “I don’t think she realized
what she did as an activist,” Karen Fong said. “She finally realizes it’s a big
deal for us in our generation.”

Indeed, telling the stories of other Asian Americans who stood up for justice
was the big deal at this year’s Fred T. Korematsu Day celebration.

“With Fred T. Korematsu Day in California, it not only lets us tell his story
for his struggle for justice and the Japanese American internment, but also to
educate people about everyone else’s struggle for justice and their stories of
standing up for what is right,” said Korematsu’s daughter, Karen.

Karen liked my idea of an ongoing “Hall of Fame,” or a shrine memorializing the
honorees. But she says her life mission at the moment is to make Korematsu Day a
national holiday.  Jan. 30th, Fred Korematsu’s birthday, is already recognized
in California, Utah, and this year in Hawaii.

The list of honorees at this year’s event included Wong Kim Ark, the Chinese
American whose case is the basis for birthright citizenship in the U.S.

It included Larry Itliong and Philip Vera Cruz, who organized farm laborers in
California but have been unfairly put in the shadow of Cesar Chavez.

There were the Japanese Americans of the U.S. Army’s 442nd Regimental Combat
Team and their legendary “Go for Broke” battle cry.

And there were the Filipino “Veteranos” of WWII, many of them Filipino Scouts,
who fought side by side with the U.S. Army, but still continue a fight for pay
equity to this day.

Included in the “veterano” group was one Lourdes Poblete, 88, who was a Filipino
guerrilla fighter at age 18. She was captured and held in a concentration camp
for six months.

“No one is treated well when you are taken,” Poblete told me. She described
being tied up from the back and suspended in the air while being questioned.
“Every time they don’t believe you, they pull it a little higher. And if your
interrogator was really mean, you get a slap in the face.”

Nothing these honorees did or were forced to endure was easy. It all took a lot
of courage and guts.

And so while the scions took the stage to stand in for their heroic forebears,
it all made me wonder if those of us in later generations have done our share.

In light of Asian Americans, the “model minority,” with the highest incomes per
racial group, known for our docility and quiet demeanor, have we lived up to our
heroes’ examples?

Have those of us in subsequent generations done enough and met the challenge of
our rich history of activists and troublemakers?

Or has our relative prosperity made us too comfortably complacent?

I posed the question to Dale Minami, a key attorney in the legal team that
overturned Korematsu’s conviction forty years after the Supreme Court decision.

“I would say on a proportional level, we probably have not carried on as much as
we could,” Minami said frankly. But you can say that of any generation, I think.
Until we have true equality we all have to step up and do something.”

And now we have a list of people to emulate.
