The tragic death of Pvt. Danny Chen is a heartbreaking outcome for his family and the entire Asian American community. His military service in Afghanistan was a true measure of his devotion to this country and its ideals of freedom. The Army failed in its obligation to protect Pvt. Chen and bring him home safely to his family. Moreover, the racial taunts and bullying that Pvt. Chen reportedly endured from his fellow soldiers should never have been allowed to take place. Now that serious charges have been brought against eight soldiers implicated in Pvt. Chenâ€™s death, the case must be handled properly and expeditiously. We hope that the truth about what happened to Pvt. Danny Chen will emerge from the proceedings, and that severe disciplinary measures are imposed on those responsible for this heinous crime.
