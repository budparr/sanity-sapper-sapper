New York—On Tuesday, December 13, residents, workers, environmentalists and community advocates will head into the final panel meeting of the EPA's WTC Expert Panel to denounce the EPA's WTC test and clean program. The EPA will come under heavy criticism for the rigged program, which the WTC Community-Labor Coalition calls an extension of the cover-up—the testing is designed to minimize the possibility of uncovering remaining WTC hazards in apartments and workplaces, and thus minimize the possibility that cleanups will be triggered.

**Who:** World Trade Center Community Labor Coalition

**When:** Tuesday, December 13, from 9am-1pm

**Where:** U.S. Customs House Auditorium, One Bowling Green

**What:** EPA WTC Expert Panel Meeting protest

**Statement by AALDEF Program Director Stan Mark:**

As the person who advocated unsuccessfully for testing and cleaning all of Chinatown and the Lower East Side and Brooklyn, I believe that the EPA's testing plan is so fundamentally flawed and scientifically unsound that there will be no clean-up even in the smaller downtown area arbitrarily designated for testing by EPA. Based on medical research data and environmental health impacts, EPA must use proper sampling methods and techniques to test and clean wherever contaminants are found in a circular area of 78.5 square miles with Ground Zero as its center.
