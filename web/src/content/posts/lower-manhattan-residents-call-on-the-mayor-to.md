**Lower Manhattan Residents Call on the Mayor to Find the Best Post 9/11 Location for Police Headquarters**

**When:** Monday, October 23, 2006, NOON

**Where:** Corner of Park Row & Worth Street at Chatham Square (Southern Corner in front of the NYPD Barricades)

**Lower Manhattan residents and civic organizations** who are concerned over the NYPD's continued lockdown of nearly 20 acres around their Headquarters are calling on the Mayor to commission an independent study to find the best location for Police Headquarters in a post-9/11 world.

The recently released **Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the One Police Plaza Security Plan** was found to be so faulty by local residents that there is concern that the door is open to make these onerous and deadly security measures permanent and leaves open the possibility of further security-based NYPD expansion in Lower Manhattan.

After five years, the NYPD still has made no plans to make the residents of Lower Manhattan safer. Residents of Lower Manhattan appear to be more of a target than the United Nations or the Empire State Building because of the proximity to 1 Police Plaza. Police Headquarters should be located away from a centralized, densely populated location.

Manhattans **Community Board #3 (CB#3)** recently passed a resolution asking the Mayor to study the relocation of Police Headquarters from their current site. CB #3 will join our traffic engineer from Community Consulting, our attorneys from Asian American Legal Defense & Education Fund and the law firm of Dewey Ballantine LLP, Asian Americans for Equality, the Chinatown Partnership, Chatham Towers, Chatham Green, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Hamilton Madison House, the Oliver Street Block Association, Southbridge Towers, businesses and workers in Lower Manhattan to present their criticisms of the DEIS and their ideas on the relocation of Police Headquarters.

**Presentation of:**

* CB#3’s Testimony and Traffic Engineer’s Analysis of the One Police Plaza Security Plan DEIS
