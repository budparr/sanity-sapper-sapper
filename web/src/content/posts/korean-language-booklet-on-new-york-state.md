YKASEC and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) Korean Workers Project announced the publication of the first-ever Korean-language booklet on New York State unemployment insurance (UI) benefits.

According to statistics from the New York State Department of Labor, the limited-English-proficient (LEP) Korean-language workforce was the fourth-largest in New York State, and 30% larger than the Polish-speaking population. Compared to other populations, however, Korean workers drastically underutilize the benefitsâ€”only 96 Korean-language speakers received UI benefits in 2003-2004, compared to 396 Polish speakers. Many eligible Korean workers do not receive UI benefits because they face serious language barriers when trying to apply for, certify, and receive UI benefits.
