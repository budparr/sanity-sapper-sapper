Last night, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 613 Asian American voters in Texas in the November 2012 Presidential elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation.

“Our exit poll results revealed that within the growing Asian American electorate in Texas, support for comprehensive immigration reform and votes for Obama were consistently high across all categories, including across party lines,” said Glenn Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program.

The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/) in jurisdictions with large Asian American populations. The exit poll in Texas included Sugarland and Houston, two cities with the largest Asian American populations, including Vietnamese (31%), Asian Indian (25%), Chinese (18%), Pakistani (11%), and Filipino (9%) American.

57% of Asian Americans polled in Texas voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. 40% of those polled voted for Mitt Romney.  Of Asian Americans surveyed, 37% were enrolled in the Democratic party, while only 26% were enrolled in the Republican party; 34% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party.

The major factors influencing the Asian American vote in Texas were economy/jobs (60%), health care (37%), education (35%), and civil rights/immigrants rights (20%). The majority of Asian Americans (59%) in Texas supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.
