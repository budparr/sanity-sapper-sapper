AALDEF has joined other education advocates to develop a white paper focusing on the No Child Left Behind Act’s (NCLB) role in pushing students, especially students of color and students with disabilities, into school discipline, juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. NCLB is the most recent version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which is scheduled for reauthorization this year.  Other advocates include, among others, the Advancement Project, the Education Law Center-PA, FairTest, The Forum for Education and Democracy, the Juvenile Law Center and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.  A copy of this white paper can be downloaded [here](/uploads/pdf/Federal%20Policy%2C%20ESEA%20Reauthorization%2C%20and%20the%20School-to-Prison%20Pipeline%20-%2001%2018%2011.pdf).
