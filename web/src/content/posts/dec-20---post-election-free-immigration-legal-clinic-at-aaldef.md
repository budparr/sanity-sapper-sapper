The 2016 presidential election results sent shockwaves to immigrant communities throughout New York City. As a response to the election, a broad coalition of nonprofits, advocacy organizations, direct service providers, and New York City government agencies is offering free immigration legal clinics for Asian American and Pacific Islander communities before President-elect Trump takes office on January 20, 2017.

Three free immigration clinics will be offered:

1. Tuesday, December 20, 6 pm – 8 pm. At AALDEF, 99 Hudson St, 12th Fl, Lower Manhattan, 10013
2. Saturday, January 7, 2017, 2 pm – 5 pm. At Renaissance Charter School, 35-59 81st St, Jackson Heights, NY 11372
3. Tuesday, January 10, 2017, 6 pm – 8 pm. At Anti-Violence Project, 116 Nassau St, Fl 3, Lower Manhattan, 10038

Walk-ins are welcome, however, online registration will ensure an interview and live translation, if requested.
