The **New Jersey Asian American Legal Project (NJ-AALP)** is an initiative of
the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) to address the
unmet legal needs of Asian Americans in New Jersey.

Although there are over half a million Asian Americans living in New Jersey, few
resources are available to assist them in overcoming the cultural and linguistic
obstacles they face when accessing legal services.

Many Asian Americans are unable to obtain legal help because they either do not
speak English well or encounter cultural barriers that discourage them from
doing so.

Moreover, many Asian Americans are unaware of their legal rights and
responsibilities under U.S. law. And those who are aware often do not exercise
their rights due to fear of how it would affect their immigration status, their
jobs, or their families. Undocumented workers can be

especially vulnerable because of their employers’ express or implied threats to
report them to authorities if they complain about workplace violations. Despite
this, there are few community resources available in the state to assist Asian
Americans with their legal needs.

NJ-AALP seeks to address this gap in legal services by providing community
education and serving as a bridge to the legal system.
