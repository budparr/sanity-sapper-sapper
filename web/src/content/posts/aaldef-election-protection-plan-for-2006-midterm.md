#### Multilingual Asian American Exit Poll Survey Expands in Eight States, to Document Voters’ Experiences and Choices in Key Congressional and State Races

 

The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), a 32-year-old civil rights group, today announced the details of its **Election Protection 2006** efforts on Election Day. Tomorrow, more than **625 attorneys, law students, and volunteers** will cover more than **60 poll sites in eight states and Washington, D.C.,** with a focus on precincts where Asian language assistance is provided, where Asian American voter registration has increased, or where Asian American voters historically have experienced intimidation.

AALDEF will document incidents of voter discrimination at poll sites, receive reports via its **toll-free hotline, 800.966.5946** and via e-mail at [votingcomplaints@aaldef.org](mailto:votingcomplaints@aaldef.org), and conduct a multilingual exit poll of Asian American voters in **New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia**, **Maryland,** and **Washington, D.C.**

Said AALDEF executive director **Margaret Fung**, "In recent elections, Asian Americans have continued to face barriers that impede their right to vote. With the dramatic increase in new citizens and first-time voters, as well as the introduction of new voting machines under the federal Help America Vote Act, we want to ensure that all eligible Asian American voters are able to participate in the electoral process in November without interference."

**Election Monitoring**

AALDEF will monitor elections in NY, NJ, MA, MI, IL, PA, VA, MD, and Washington, D.C. for:

* Compliance with language assistance (ballots, interpreters, signs and voting materials) required by the Voting Rights Act, court order, state statute, or voluntary agreement;
* Properly functioning voting machines; and
* Non-discriminatory implementation of voter identification requirements in all states.
  </ul>

Voters can also report Election Day problems to AALDEFs Election Day Hotline toll-free at 800.966.5946, or by e-mail at [votingcomplaints@aaldef.org](mailto:votingcomplaints@aaldef.org).

AALDEF staff attorney **Glenn D. Magpantay** reports, "In recent elections, our Election Protection volunteers have identified egregiously mistranslated ballots, interpreter shortages that led to Asian American voters being turned away, and poll workers who made hostile and racist remarks about Asian American voters. This year, 500 volunteers will guard against the disenfranchisement of new citizens or limited English proficient voters that could tarnish the results of local or federal races."

AALDEF recently initiated several lawsuits to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans. In February 2006, AALDEF sued the New York City Board of Elections for violations of the Voting Rights Acts language assistance provisions, which mandate Chinese and Korean ballots and interpreters. AALDEF is currently seeking to intervene into the U.S. Department of Justices lawsuit against the New York State Board of Elections for noncompliance with the Help America Vote Act. In 2005, AALDEF also supported the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the City of Boston that resulted in a settlement requiring that ballots be translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.

**Multilingual Exit Polls**

On November 7, AALDEFs multilingual volunteers will conduct an exit poll of Asian American voters in **nine languages** Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Khmer, Bengali, Arabic, Punjabi, Urdu, and Gujarati. Voters will be asked about their preferences in top federal and state elections, party affiliations, and opinions on key issues, as well as any election irregularities or problems encountered at the polls.

This year, AALDEF aims to survey **5,000 Asian American voters**. The exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns and priorities that are often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988, noting the steadily growing involvement of new voters.

[AALDEFs 2004 exit poll](/news/the-asian-american-vote-2004-a-report-on-the)—which surveyed nearly 11,000 voters—revealed that more than one third (38%) of Asian Americans surveyed were first-time voters, of which nearly one half (46%) used language assistance in order to vote.

AALDEF is partnering with several groups to mobilize volunteer attorneys, law students, college students and community activists on Election Day.
