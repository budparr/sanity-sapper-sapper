The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), a 38-year old national civil rights organization, announced that it will dispatch over 600 attorneys, law students, and community volunteers to 14 states to document voting problems in the November 6th elections. AALDEF will also conduct a nonpartisan multilingual exit poll in 12 languages to document Asian American voting preferences, in light of the surge in newly-registered voters and expected high turnout in this Presidential election.

> “We want to ensure that all eligible Asian Americans can participate in the electoral process and have their votes counted in this critical Presidential election,” said Margaret Fung, AALDEF Executive Director.

AALDEF plans to poll 10,000 Asian American voters on Election Day in 14 states with large Asian American populations: New York, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, California, and Washington, D.C.

**POLL MONITORING**

In response to a wave of new state voter identification and proof of citizenship laws, AALDEF will monitor over 100 poll sites to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act and the Help America Vote Act. These poll sites are in areas with large numbers of newly-registered Asian American voters, jurisdictions in which Asian-language assistance must be provided, and sites where Asian Americans have reported voting barriers or intimidation in recent elections. Volunteer attorneys will check to see whether Asian-language voting assistance has been provided (such as ballots, interpreters, signs, and voting materials) and whether provisional ballots are offered to voters whose names are not in voter lists. Attorneys will monitor the sites to ensure that voter identification requirements are implemented in a non-discriminatory manner.

“In the 2008 elections, Asian Americans had to overcome numerous obstacles to exercise their right to vote,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, AALDEF Democracy Program Director. “AALDEF volunteers identified mistranslated ballots, interpreter shortages that led to Asian American voters being turned away, and poll workers who made hostile and racist remarks about Asian American voters. AALDEF will guard against the disenfranchisement of new citizens and limited English proficient voters.”

**MULTILINGUAL EXIT POLL**

AALDEF will conduct a nonpartisan exit poll of Asian American voters in 12 languages: Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Tagalog, Khmer, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, and Gujarati. Voters will be asked about their preferences in the Presidential and local races, their priorities in choosing a candidate, their party affiliations, whether they are first-time voters, their use of Asian-language voting assistance, and any specific problems encountered at the polls.

AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major

election since 1988, noting the steadily increasing numbers of new

citizens and first-time voters. The AALDEF exit poll reveals vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. In the 2008 Presidential election, AALDEF polled 16,665 Asian American voters in 11 states — the largest poll of its kind in the nation — and found that of all Asian Americans polled:

* 79% were foreign-born naturalized U.S. citizens;
* 31% were first-time voters;
* 35% were limited English proficient;
* 58% were enrolled Democrats, 13% were enrolled Republicans, and 26% were not enrolled in any political party; and
* 76% voted for Barack Obama and 23% voted for John McCain.

**MULTILINGUAL VOTER HOTLINE: 800-966-5946**

Multilingual volunteers will be at poll sites to take complaints from voters about election irregularities and other barriers to voting. Voters can also report Election Day problems to AALDEF’s toll-free Election Day Hotline at 800-966-5946, or by e-mail to [votingcomplaints@aaldef.org](mailto:votingcomplaints@aaldef.org).

**PARTNERSHIPS AND TRAININGS**

AALDEF is partnering with 75 national and local groups to mobilize volunteer attorneys, law students, undergraduate students, and community activists on Election Day. AALDEF will also be conducting a series of trainings for volunteers in nine cities across the country that are listed below.
