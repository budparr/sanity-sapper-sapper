"The Senate immigration reform compromise is unacceptable. Family reunification has been the cornerstone of our nation’s immigration policy since 1965, when the U.S. government replaced discriminatory quotas that excluded Asian immigration for generations. The proposal would eliminate essential family categories that Asian Americans rely on to reunite their families. If enacted, such a policy would have devastating impacts on Asian Americans, whose families already face some of the longest delays," said **AALDEF Senior Staff Attorney Stanley Mark**. "We urge Congress to reject this proposal."
