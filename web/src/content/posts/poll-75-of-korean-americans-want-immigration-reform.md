December 20, 2013 – According to the results of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund’s (AALDEF) exit poll in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, 75% of Korean Americans polled support immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Moreover, 63% of Korean American voters polled said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate for Congress who supported comprehensive immigration reform, [compared](/press-release/new-poll-even-gop-asian-americans-favor-candidates-who-support-immigration-reform/) to 52% of Asian Americans overall.

The exit poll also indicated that extremely high numbers of Korean American voters are independent. In Virginia, 46% of Korean American voters indicated that they were not enrolled in any party, compared to 38% enrolled in the Democratic Party and 13% enrolled in the Republican Party. New Jersey and New York both had a majority of registered Korean American Democrats, with 55% in New Jersey and 76% in New York. However, in the New Jersey gubernatorial elections, Korean American voters were evenly divided among candidates, with 49% voting for Republican Chris Christie and 49% voting for Democrat Barbara Buono.

“Immigration reform is a nonpartisan issue for Korean Americans,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program. “There is tremendous political diversity within the Korean American community, with extremely high numbers of independent voters. Nonetheless, immigration reform appears to be a unifying issue for the community.”

AALDEF’s nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 2,290 Asian American voters was conducted at 24 poll sites after the mayoral election in New York and the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. 547 Korean American voters were polled in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York.

“NAKASEC mailed in-language voter guidebooks to 10,000 households and witnessed a growing interest from the Korean American community,” said Dae Joong Yoon, NAKASEC Executive Director at National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC). “The exit poll results clearly demonstrate our community’s focus to elect lawmakers who favor sensible immigration policies and responsible fiscal policy for low-income community members.”

AALDEF’s exit poll further indicated that language assistance remains essential to Korean American access to the vote, with 75% of all Korean Americans polled reading English less than “very well.”

“Language continues to be a barrier for Korean Americans in accessing the ballot,” said Grace Shim, Executive Director of MinKwon Center for Community Action. “Efforts such as AALDEF’s exit survey are valuable tools not only in understanding our community’s needs, but monitoring violations and protecting Asian American voters from discrimination in exercising their right to vote.”

Korean American voters also faced a [number of barriers](/press-release/asian-american-civil-rights-group-reports-voting-violations-on-election-day/) in exercising their right to vote. Interpreter shortages made voting difficult for limited English proficient voters. Voters reported of hostile poll workers, excessive demands for identification, broken voting machines, and misdirection by poll workers.

All of these voter problems were reported to the state and local elections officials on Election Day.
