**Just Between You and Me – and the NSA?**

**A Town Hall Meeting on Domestic Spying, NSA Surveillance, and the Rule of Law**

**Date:** January 16, 2007

**Time:** 7:00 – 9:00 pm

**Location:** NYU School of Law, Lipton Hall, 108 W. 3rd Street

In 2001, President Bush issued a secret executive order authorizing warrantless electronic surveillance of people in the United States. In May 2006, the nation learned that the National Security Agency has been building a massive database of Americans’ phone records.

Does the NSA’s practice violate the Constitution? How far should the government be allowed to go in the name of fighting terrorism?

Join the New York Civil Liberties Union and other co-sponsoring organizations for a free town hall meeting to discuss warrantless wiretapping and what it means for our democracy.

Share your thoughts on government spying with experts on both sides of the debate, including:

* Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Chair, Constitution Subcommittee, U.S. House of Representatives;
* Ann Beeson, lead attorney, ACLU vs. NSA, and ACLU Associate Legal Director;
* Andrew McCarthy, former supervisor of the U.S. Attorney’s Anti-Terrorism Command Post in New York City, and lead prosecutor of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman; and
* Timothy Bakken, Professor of Law, United States Military Academy at West Point.
