> The 20th District of the New York City Council represents one of the biggest Asian American populations in New York City. After growing 67 percent from 1990 to 2000, the Asian American population in Flushing now constitutes the majority of the community. While the Flushing Asian American community has experienced spectacular growth, it continues to face many pressing issues: a lack of affordable housing, few resources for English-Language-Learner students, and access to healthcare. This forum will discuss these concerns and other important topics for the Asian American community in District 20.
