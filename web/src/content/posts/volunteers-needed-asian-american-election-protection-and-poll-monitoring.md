NY, NJ, VA Election Day – November 5, 2013

In past elections, Asian Americans have faced a series of barriers in exercising their right to vote.  For example, poll workers were hostile and made racist remarks, poll sites had too few interpreters to assist Asian American voters, translated voting materials were missing or hidden from voters, and ballots were mistranslated listing Democratic candidates as Republicans, and vice versa.  Then, when the news media reported on election returns and the vote by specific groups, Asian Americans were often overlooked.

In response, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund has conducted a non-partisan survey of Asian American voters to document Asian American voting patterns.  AALDEF has also monitored the elections for compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act, which mandates bilingual ballots and forbids anti-Asian voter discrimination.

On Election Day, AALDEF along with several other Asian American groups will be monitoring the elections and conducting non-partisan voter surveys at poll sites in Asian American neighborhoods.  **We need your help.**

In 2012, 800 volunteers polled 9,096 Asian American voters in fourteen states and Washington, DC.  Volunteers are needed to administer a multilingual voter survey in 3-hour shifts and document voting problems on Election Day.  Polls are generally open from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

There will be a one hour training session for all volunteers (Ninety minutes for CLE credits and pro bono hours for admission).  All volunteers must be non-partisan during the time that they help.
