Volunteers from the Lehman Brothers will partner with AALDEF on July 22 in Flushing, Queens, to educate Asian Americans about their legal rights and to register new voters. Asian American communities often do not have access to free, in-language legal advice, and represent an emerging electorate as one of New York Citys fast-growing populations. AALDEF attorneys will be on hand to answer individuals basic legal questions. Lehman Brothers volunteers will distribute leaflets on immigrants rights, human trafficking, and youth rights, as well as register new voters. Assistance will be provided in English, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Hindi, Punjabi, Tagalog, and Urdu.

Details: Saturday, July 22, 2006, 10:30 AM to 3:00 PM in front of Amerasia Bank, 41-06 Main Street in Flushing, NY
