Huffington Post — ESPN has fired the employee responsible for the offensive
headline “Chink in the Armor.” The network has suspended the anchor who also
used the phrase, [the Associated Press
reports.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/19/espn-fires-employee-jeremy-lin-headline_n_1287591.html) —

Though ESPN apologized for referring to Jeremy Lin as “Chink in the Armor”
Friday night, an Asian-American civil rights organization isn’t satisfied with
the response.

ESPN changed the headline, and apologized, but the [Asian American Legal Defense
and Education Fund](https://aaldef.org/), an organization that promotes civil
rights for Asian Americans, wants the network to do even more.

[In a statement posted its
site](/press-release/aaldef-statement-to-espn-on-racism-in-jeremy-lin-coverage/),
the AALDEF said that the term used was “inexcusable” and wants ESPN to apologize
on air so that “it is clear to all viewers that this racist language is
unacceptable.”

The AALDEF offered to meet with the network to help educate its staff and
establish procedures to prevent such slurs from appearing in their work.

“The time for apologies is over” [the AALDEF
wrote.](/press-release/aaldef-statement-to-espn-on-racism-in-jeremy-lin-coverage/)

“The media and the general public must understand that racist language and
stereotypes used to describe Jeremy Lin are an insult to all Asian Americans,
and no one should tolerate their use.”

The headline originated after the Hornets ended the Knicks’ seven-game winning
streak, [and ESPN attributed the loss to Jeremy Lin’s nine turnovers, and posted
the story with the offensive headline.

“We are conducting a complete review of our cross-platform editorial procedures
and are determining appropriate disciplinary action to ensure this does not
happen again,” [ESPN wrote in a statement on its site
Saturday.](https://www.espnmediazone3.com/us/2012/02/18/statement-on-new-york-knicks-jeremy-lin-headline/)
“We regret and apologize for this mistake.”

The incident came just three days after an ESPN anchor used the term “chink in
the armor” and one day after the owner of the Knicks aired an offensive image of
Lin popping out of a fortune cookie, ESPN published the insensitive headline.
