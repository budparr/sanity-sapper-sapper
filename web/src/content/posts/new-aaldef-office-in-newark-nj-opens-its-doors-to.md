Newark, NJ - More than 600,000 Asian Americans live in New Jersey, but few resources exist that are culturally and linguistically appropriate to meet the needs of the nations fifth-largest Asian American population. Today, **AALDEF** celebrated the opening of a second office on 89 Market Street, 8th floor in Newark for its **New Jersey Asian American Legal Project (NJ-AALP)**.

Over the past year, **AALDEF NJ-AALP Director and Staff Attorney Alexander Saingchin** has expanded the projects services and resources, which now include a multilingual helpline and free legal clinics to serve the states burgeoning Filipino, South Asian, Korean, and Chinese American populations in northern and central New Jersey. AALDEF NJ-AALP is currently focused on addressing the most pressing unmet legal needs in the Asian American community workers rights and immigrant rights.

Under the guidance of AALDEF, a 33-year-old civil rights organization, NJ-AALP volunteer attorneys provide free, confidential legal advice to Asian immigrant workers in Gujarati, Hindi, Korean, Tagalog, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English through partnerships with community organizations and law schools in Bergen, Hudson, Middlesex, and Essex counties.

Said Saingchin, "This year, our clinics have assisted dozens of Asian immigrant workers with questions about minimum wage, overtime, and immigration law, and who come to understand they have a way out of unfair or exploitative situations. In addition to increasing our outreach, NJ-AALP is now offering direct legal representation."

Asian immigrant workers have sought help at AALDEF NJ-AALP clinics for a wide range of legal problems:

* Ms. Santos, an immigrant from the Philippines, worked from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. in a Bergen County home where she cooked, cleaned, and tended to the needs of her employer. Although she worked more than 87 hours per week, seven days a week, Ms. Santos was only paid $100 a day, without any overtime.
* Mr. Patel, an immigrant from India, labored as a construction worker on various public buildings in Hudson County. His employer required him to work every day from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., yet his wages amounted to only $4.10 an hour. Mr. Patel is owed thousands of dollars in unpaid overtime and prevailing wages.
* Mr. Chin is a Korean immigrant of Chinese descent who worked as a day laborer in Bergen County. His employer would pick up him and his brother from the same location every day to perform interior construction work in upscale homes in northern New Jersey. Despite working more than 40 hours per week, the employer failed to pay them most of their wages and never compensated the brothers with any overtime pay.

Since the Projects launch in 2005, NJ-AALP has assisted more than 200 Asian American New Jersey residents with free legal advice, including information about their right to a minimum wage in restaurant, service, construction, and manufacturing industries. NJ-AALP has also held monthly evening clinics at local community organizations.

New Jersey residents or workers with questions regarding employment law may now call NJ-AALP toll-free at  **888.406.1555** to receive more information, or to schedule an appointment for legal advice. The helpline is available in English and five Asian languages and dialects.

Saingchin is a Jersey City resident and a graduate of the Rutgers University School of Law, where he received the Judge J. Skelly Wright Prize for his work on behalf of Asian Americans in New Jersey. In 2005, he received the Martindale-Hubbell Exemplary Public Service Award from Equal Justice Works, and he is now an Equal Justice Works Fellow at AALDEF.

The NJ-AALP office opening marks an expansion of AALDEF's efforts to promote racial and economic justice for Asian Americans. Over the past 33 years, AALDEF attorneys have won millions of dollars in back wages and overtime pay for low-wage Asian American workers and engaged in precedent-setting litigation to enforce federal and state labor laws. In addition to workers rights, AALDEF focuses on critical issues affecting Asian Americans, including immigrant rights, civic participation and voting rights, language access to services, Census policy, affirmative action, youth rights and educational equity, and the elimination of anti-Asian violence, police misconduct, and human trafficking.

NJ-AALP is supported with the generous assistance of The IOLTA Fund of the Bar of New Jersey.

**Demographic profile of Asian Americans in New Jersey**

_(Source: U.S. Census Bureaus 2005 American Community Survey and the 2000 Census. Asian American here is defined by the Asian alone category, since that is the only category of data currently available from the 2005 Census.)_

* An estimated **620,588** Asian Americans lived in the State of New Jersey in 2005, an increase of approximately 29%, nearly a third over Census estimates in 2000.

* Chinese: 122,931
