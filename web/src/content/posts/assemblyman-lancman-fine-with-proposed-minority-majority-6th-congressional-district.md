WNYC — Just hours after a federal judge’s proposed congressional maps were picked up by the media, Assemblyman Rory Lancman, who had intended to run against Republican Congressman Bob Turner, saw himself drawn into an entirely new district–one without an incumbent–in the judge’s plans.

Let’s take a look at that proposed 6th district. For starters, this appears to be pretty close to the district AALDEF and other community groups proposed District 5 in their UNITY map.

A quick look at the voting age population of the new district:  
**White: 39.9%  
**Hispanic: 17.1%  
Black: 4.8%  
**Asian: 38.8%**

Which is all to say, the district’s voting age population in majority minority, and the largest chunk in that group is the Asian community. It will be interesting, if these lines become real, to see how that dynamic shapes the candidates in the race.
