IndiaWest -- The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund will honor Mumbai-born journalist Fareed Zakaria with its 2012 Justice in Action Award at its Annual Lunar New Year Gala Feb. 8, 2012.

The AALDEF Justice in Action Awards recognize exceptional individuals for their outstanding achievements and contributions in advancing justice and equality. Past recipients include the late civil rights icon Fred Korematsu, David Henry Hwang, Harold Koh, Mira Nair, Deval Patrick, Salman Rushdie and Seymour Hersh.

Two other leaders to be honored at the gala are Parkin Lee, vice president, chief legal officer, and secretary of The Rockefeller Group; and Yale Law professor Jean Koh Peters.

Zakaria hosts CNN's flagship foreign affairs show "GPS" and serves as editor-at-large of Time Magazine. He is also a frequent columnist for the Washington Post and is the New York Times bestselling author of "The Post-American World" and its newly updated edition, "The Post-American World 2.0," and "The Future of Freedom." In 2010, Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the top 100 global thinkers.

The co-emcees for the Feb. 12 gala are Juju Chang, Emmy Award-winning correspondent for ABC News Nightline; and Sree Sreenivasan, dean of student affairs and digital media professor at Columbia Journalism School, and the founder of the South Asian Journalists Association.

More than 600 leaders of the civil rights, legal, business, and arts communities are expected to attend AALDEF's 2012 Lunar New Year Gala celebrating the Year of the Dragon. Since 1974, AALDEF has been protecting and promoting the civil rights of Asian Americans across the nation through litigation, advocacy, organizing, and community education. All proceeds from the Lunar New Year Gala will go directly towards supporting AALDEF's legal and educational programs in immigrant rights, economic justice for workers, voting rights and civic participation, affirmative action, language access to services, youth rights and educational equity, housing and environmental justice, Census policy, and the elimination of hate violence, police misconduct, and human trafficking.
