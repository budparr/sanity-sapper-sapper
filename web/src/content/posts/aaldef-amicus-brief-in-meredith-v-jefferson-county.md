#### United State Supreme Court 

Civil rights groups Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and Asian American Justice Center (AAJC), with educational and advocacy groups nationwide, filed amicus briefs in the United States Supreme Court in support of voluntary racial integration in the cases of Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education, et al., and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1.

In both cases, locally elected school boards recognized that longstanding patterns of residential segregation, coupled with the withdrawal of court supervision over school desegregation, have produced schools artificially isolated by race that fail to reflect the diversity of their communities. In response, the school districts of Seattle, Washington and Louisville, Kentucky voluntarily adopted measures to take race—among other factors—into account in kindergarten to 12th-grade school assignments.
