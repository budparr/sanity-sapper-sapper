On June 15, 2012, the Obama administration announced that it would grant
“[deferred action][1]” status to young people who qualify for administrative
relief. The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) will hold a
series of legal clinics to provide free legal advice and representation to
people who qualify under this directive. These clinics help to support the work
of AALDEF’s undocumented Asian American [youth group][2].

The first legal clinic will be at AALDEF’s office on Thursday, July 12, 2012
from 3pm – 7pm. Additional clinics will be scheduled in upcoming weeks.

“This new directive is a good first step,” said Bethany Li, staff attorney at
AALDEF. “But for this policy to make any difference, undocumented Asian American
youth need to understand its effect and continue to be at the forefront in
asserting their rights. These legal clinics combined with the youth group will
help to push the discussion around our immigration policy forward.”

AALDEF is also providing resources for undocumented youth on its website,
including an in-depth set of [FAQs on deferred action eligibility][3], which
explains who qualifies for deferred action, and how this policy affects removal
proceedings and encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The legal clinics are only open to youth who potentially qualify for deferred
action status and are seeking legal advice. They are not open to the press.
