The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) joined civil
rights and pro-immigrant advocacy groups in criticizing today’s U.S. Supreme
Court opinion in [United States v. Texas](/uploads/pdf/USvTexasopinion.pdf) as a setback for immigrants and
their families. In a 4-4 vote, the Court let stand a lower court decision
upholding the nationwide injunction against President Obama’s executive actions
on immigration, announced in November 2014. While setting no precedent, today’s
decision effectively blocks the administration’s new Deferred Action for
Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) initiative and its
expansion of the original Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
program. Margaret Fung, AALDEF executive director, said: “As a national civil
rights organization that advocates for fair immigration policies, we strongly
supported the president’s immigration actions that would have provided relief
from deportation and employment authorization to an estimated 400,000 out of a
total of almost 1.5 million undocumented Asian immigrants in this country.
While the Court’s split decision is a setback that has delayed the hopes of
millions of undocumented immigrants and  their families, we will explore all
options in continuing the fight for immigrant rights. In the meantime, we urge
the Department of Justice to seek a rehearing when a ninth justice is confirmed
to the Supreme Court.Annie Wang, AALDEF staff attorney, said:  “AALDEF will
continue to offer legal assistance to Asian immigrant youth who may be eligible
for the original DACA program, which was unaffected by this case. We will also
offer consultations to individuals who would have qualified for the new DAPA
and expanded DACA initiatives to determine if other forms of relief are
available to them.”The lawsuit against the president’s executive actions was
brought by 26 states, led by Texas. The Obama administration’s new DAPA
initiative and the expansion of the 2012 DACA program were blocked by a federal
district court in Texas in February 2015; that court’s order was later upheld
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Last December, the federal
government appealed to the Supreme Court.

Individuals who believe they would have qualified for the new DAPA and expanded
DACA initiatives but for this decision should go to reputable attorneys and
nonprofit legal service providers to see if they qualify for DACA or other forms
of immigration relief. They should also be wary of individuals claiming that
they can help get work authorization for a fee without applying for a benefit.
