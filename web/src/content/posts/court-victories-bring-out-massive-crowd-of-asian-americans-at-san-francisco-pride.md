It was like an early Independence Day celebration.

Pride parades took place in New York, Houston, and San Francisco over the
weekend. As a straight male, I witnessed the scene in all three cities in the
past. (I remember going to the Farm House in Houston in 1975!) As a journalist
in San Francisco, I covered the parade in the Castro district in the 80s. Having
grown up in the neighborhood, I’ve witnessed the amazing evolution of Pride–now
it practically engulfs the city and its Civic Center. (And Leather Alley/the
Fetish Zone are on the same street as Hastings College of the Law.)

Of course, Asian Americans were a part of the celebration.

South Asians were well represented.

Ralph Bolano, a Filipino American immigrant, said this Pride was special because
of the Supreme Court’s rulings on Prop 8 and DOMA earlier in the week.

One Asian American man draped himself in the flag as he walked by me with his
partner.
