The Supreme Court has decided not to hear the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) cases in the current term, which means that DACA will remain in effect for at least one more year. (See our [press release](https://www.aaldef.org/press-release/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-daca-cases-aaldef-calls-on-congress-to-reject-white-house-proposal-to-end-government-shutdown-in-exchange-for-limited-daca-and-tps-protections/) on this new development.)

What now?

Know your rights! Come to AALDEF's free DACA renewal clinic on Thursday, January 31, 2019, 6 to 8 pm.

You can download our latest January 2019 fact sheet about DACA [here](https://www.aaldef.org/uploads/Jan2019-DACA fact sheet.pdf).
