The **AALDEF Korean Workers Project (KWP)** is the only project in the East Coast designed specifically to serve the needs of low-income workers of Korean descent.

The Project provides traditional direct legal services, and also works in conjunction with YKASEC—Empowering the Korean American Community to offer community education and outreach efforts. There are over 200,000 Korean Americans working in the New York City area, many of them living below the poverty line. These working poor include waiters, hairdressers, nail salon workers, and grocery cashiers. Many workers in the Korean community are often subjected to serious, unlawful labor violations—they are not properly paid minimum wage or overtime, are forced to work in hazardous conditions, for overly long hours, and without proper safety equipment. Many face additional barriers because they are immigrants and/or non-citizens.

KWP is designed to protect the rights of these Korean immigrant workers and to help them achieve social and economic justice.
