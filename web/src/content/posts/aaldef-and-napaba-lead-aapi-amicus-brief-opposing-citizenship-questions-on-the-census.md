Filipino Reporter - On April 1, 2019, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court opposing the addition of a proposed citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

Sixty-four (64) bar associations and AAPI-serving community organizations joined the brief.

AALDEF executive director Margaret Fung said, “Asian-Americans are the fasting-growing racial group in this country and make up the largest segment of new immigrants. Adding a question concerning citizenship on the decennial census will uniquely harm our community and will undermine the purported reason for adding the question in the first place — more effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. We are pleased to work with NAPABA on this brief and to fight with our legal and community partners from around the country on this critical issue.” . . .
