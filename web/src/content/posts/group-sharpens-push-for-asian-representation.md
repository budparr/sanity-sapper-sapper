![Asian Voters.JPG](/uploads/Asian%20Voters.JPG)Capital Tonight -- As the proposed maps for new state and federal offices remain a closely guarded secret in Albany, the Asian American Legal Defense Fund filed a complaint in U.S. District Court to push for an independent process.

The group argues that with the growing Asian population in New York -- 32 percent in the last 10 years alone -- the redistricting process must take those figures into consideration.

The argument is similar to one made during the last redistricting process in 2001-02 when Hispanic and Latino groups pushed for greater representation.

> "The Asian American community must be represented in the NY redistricting process because its political power is particularly weakened by the current district lines," said Jerry Vattamala, Staff Attorney at AALDEF's Democracy Program. "Asian Americans voters constitute a majority only in one NY state assembly district and not a single state senate or Congressional district. No Asian American has ever been elected to the NY state senate or the U.S. Congress."

The organization earlier this year [unveiled its own proposals](http://aaldef.org/unity-map.html) for new lines in what they called the "Unity Map."

Redistricting, which must be done every 10 years based on the most recent Census data, is often a highly litigious process. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly promised to veto lines not drawn by an independent commission.

Update: I'm reminded that Common Cause's [proposed maps](http://www.citizensredistrictny.org/) also created Asian-influence districts for the ninth congressional and 16th Senate district.

As we've noted before, Senate Republicans under Dean Skelos are making a concerted effort to reach out to Hispanic voters, whose numbers have swelled in suburban New York City.
