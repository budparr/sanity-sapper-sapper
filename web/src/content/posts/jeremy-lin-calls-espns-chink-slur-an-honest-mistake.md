![240](/uploads/240_Lin1.jpg)Colorlines -- On Saturday ESPN apologized for comments made by two employees who referred to Jeremy Lin as a "chink in armor." The following day Lin said he doesn't think the offensive comments made about him on the sports network were intentional.

"I don't think it was on purpose or whatever, but they have apologized and so from my end I don't care anymore," Lin said in a televised interview after leading the Knicks to a 104- 97 win over Dallas yesterday. "Have to learn to forgive and I don't even think that was intentional. Or hopefully not."

[On Saturday ESPN published a short apology online that referred to the statements as offensive:](http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/7591778/espn-statement-offensive-jeremy-lin-comments)

> "We again apologize, especially to Mr. Lin. His accomplishments are a source of great pride to the Asian-American community, including the Asian-American employees at ESPN. Through self-examination, improved editorial practices and controls, and response to constructive criticism, we will be better in the future."

"Although ESPN issued a statement apologizing for its lapse in editorial judgment, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund ([AALDEF](http://aaldef.org/)) asks that this apology be aired prominently on ESPN's television programs, so that it is clear to all viewers that this racist language is unacceptable," read a statement sent Saturday by [AALDEF.](http://aaldef.org/)

The ESPN headline followed one day after Madison Square Garden, owner of the Knicks, aired [a controversial fan sign of Jeremy Lin popping out of a fortune cookie](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31751_162-57379127-10391697/msg-airs-jeremy-lin-fortune-cookie-sign/), and after Fox Sports Columnist [Jason Whitlock apologized for his offensive tweet about Jeremy Lin](http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/jason-whitlock-jeremy-lin-whitlock-sorry-for-lin-tweet-021112). It appeared three days after an ESPN anchor used the exact same phrase "Chink in the Armor" on air in an interview about Jeremy Lin.

"The time for apologies is over. The media and the general public must understand that racist language and stereotypes used to describe Jeremy Lin are an insult to all Asian Americans, and no one should tolerate their use," the [AALDEF](http://aaldef.org/) statement went on to say.
