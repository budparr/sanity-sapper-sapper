**Documenting the impacts of the NYPD Surveillance unit on the Muslim community, and freedom of religion and civic practices in New York City.**

![Presser5.jpg](/uploads/Presser5.jpg)The press has widely reported NYPD surveillance of Muslim communities in New York City and surrounding areas. The Muslim American Civil Liberties Coalition (MACLC) and the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility project (CLEAR) at CUNY School of Law, in conjunction with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), is undertaking a project to document the scope and the impacts of the NYPD surveillance program on Muslim communities in New York City.

In researching this report, we aim to interview a broad spectrum of Muslim New Yorkers: community leaders; activists; representatives of masjids; business owners; students; individuals or families that have been affected by the program. The report aims to include a wide array of voices on these issues to convey the effects of this program on Muslim communities. We hope that the report can be used as a community education and organizing tool, to work towards more responsible law enforcement practices in New York City.
