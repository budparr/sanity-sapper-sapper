#### Findings Illuminate Asian American Vote for Senate, Voter Priorities for the 2008 Elections, and Party Enrollment Patterns

Arlington, VAâ€”Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its multilingual exit poll of hundreds of Asian American voters during the November 2006 midterm elections. AALDEF, a 33-year-old national civil rights organization, polled more than 4,700 Asian American voters in 23 cities and in nine states on Election Day nationwide: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

In conjunction with Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, **AALDEF Staff Attorney Glenn Magpantay** presented findings from the 2006 exit poll with comparative information in the following areas:

* Vote in Virginias U.S. Senate race
* Party enrollment
* Voter priorities for the 2008 Elections
* First-time voting by ethnicity

More than 30 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans.

The May 30 presentation was co-sponsored by the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans of Virginia, APIAVote, Asian Pacific American Bar Association of the Greater Washington, D.C.
