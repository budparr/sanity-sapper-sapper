**Raise Our Story: A Collection of Photographs and Stories of Undocumented Asian
Youth**

RAISE (Revolutionizing Asian Immigrant Stories on the East Coast), a pan-Asian
group of undocumented Asian youth, is launching [Raise Our Story](https://raiseourstory.tumblr.com/), a social media collection of photographs and stories that illustrate the unique and diverse stories of undocumented Asian immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. On May 20 at the Culture Project in NYC, RAISE, in collaboration with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), will present [#UndocuAsians](https://undocuasian.eventbrite.com), a new film and theater performance by undocumented Asian American youth.

May 16, 2013 – RAISE (Revolutionizing Asian Immigrant Stories on the East Coast) is launching _Raise Our Story_, a social media project for sharing the inspiring stories of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.  _Raise Our Story_ focuses on the individual profiles of undocumented Asian immigrants who are often overlooked in the narrative surrounding immigration reform. These individuals share their stories in order to use the power of narrative to influence immigration reform and to empower the thousands of undocumented Asian Americans who have lived in a culture of silence. 

“_Raise Our Story_ serves as a reminder that real individuals — and their
struggles, hopes, and dreams — lie at the core of our country’s current
immigration debate,” said Jill Damatac Futter, the photographer and curator of
Raise Our Story. “Individuals’ stories are increasingly crucial in stirring
deeper thought, understanding, and progress.”

_Raise Our Story_ aims to illustrate the diversity of the undocumented
experience. Profiles feature undocumented Asian youth born in countries
including Singapore, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Peru. Featured members
recount their experiences struggling to pay for higher education, hiding their
status from their peers, finding their rights limited as low-wage industry
workers, and grappling with the sacrifices made by their parents. Long- form
versions of the first stories from _Raise Our Story_ will be featured on [The
Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hong-mei-pang/why-i-share-my-status-as-_b_3280540.html).

“Growing up Asian and undocumented, I was constantly searching for people who
could identify with the unique struggles I faced,” said Hong Mei Pang, 24, a
member of RAISE. “This important project provides undocumented Asian youth with
stories they can relate to. I chose to share my story so that others in my
situation can be empowered by the movement for immigration reform.”

RAISE, the first undocumented pan-Asian youth group on the East Coast, was
launched by AALDEF to address the fact that Asian undocumented immigrants have
seemingly been less visible in the debate over immigration reform.

“Undocumented youth have been at the heart of the immigration reform movement,”
said Bethany Li, staff attorney at AALDEF who provides legal support to RAISE
members. “As we continue to push for family reunification, greater protections
for all workers, and a just and humane path to citizenship, their stories are
more powerful and necessary than ever.”
