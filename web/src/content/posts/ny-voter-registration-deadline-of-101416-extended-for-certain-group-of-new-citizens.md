In New York State, the deadline to register in order to vote in the Nov. 8, 2016
elections is Friday, Oct. 14. It is also the deadline to register in a political
party or change your party registration if you want to the vote in the 2017 NYC
primary elections.

You can mail in your voter registration [form](https://www.nyccfb.info/nyc-votes/registering) (it must be postmarked by 10/14/16).

You can also register [online through the DMV](https://dmv.ny.gov/more-info/electronic-voter-registration-application) (you must have a NYS driver’s license).

However, the Oct. 14 voter registration deadline is extended for
newly-naturalized citizens who take their citizenship oath on or after Oct. 15.
This group of new citizens can register in person at their local Board of
elections on or before Saturday, Oct. 29. See New York State Board of Elections
