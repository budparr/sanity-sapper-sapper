The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), in partnership
with the Asian American Bar Association of New York (AABANY), the National
Center for Law and Economic Justice (NCLEJ), the New York Coalition for Asian
American Mental Health (NYCAAMH), and the Chinese-American Family Alliance for
Mental Health (CAFAMH), will be holding a free one-day legal and mental health
event on Sunday Oct. 1, 2017, from 12 noon to 4:30 pm at Flushing Library (IRC
Conference Room), 41-17 Main Street, Flushing, NY 11355.

The event will provide information and resources for Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. Volunteer attorneys will be on-site to
help eligible DACA recipients complete their renewal forms to meet the Oct. 5,
2017 renewal deadline. Please bring all necessary documents and paperwork. _We
may be able to assist with the fees_.

Bilingual and bicultural AAPI mental health providers will be available on-site
to provide supportive counseling to DACA recipients and their family. The
providers will listen and offer suggestions to help you cope with your stress
level. We will protect the anonymity and confidentality of all participants.

Congresswoman Grace Meng, who represents New Yorkâ€™s 6th District, will make a
few remarks at the beginning of the event.
