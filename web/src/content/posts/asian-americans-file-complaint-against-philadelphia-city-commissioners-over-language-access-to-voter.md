Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) filed a
complaint against the Philadelphia City Commissioners for refusing to provide
language assistance to Asian American voters, in violation of the Philadelphia
Fair Practices Ordinance (FPO).

Jerry Vattamala, staff attorney in AALDEF’s Democracy Program, said, “Asian
American voters who are limited English proficient repeatedly have been unable
to exercise their right to vote. This failure to provide Asian language
assistance violates the FPO’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of
language.”

Naturalized Asian American citizens who are limited English proficient (“LEP”)
are a substantial segment of Philadelphia’s naturalized voters. The
Commissioners have failed to provide adequate Asian language assistance through
interpreters and translated voter registration forms, ballots, instruction
forms, and exterior signage during elections.

The FPO protects anyone who lives in, works in, or visits Philadelphia from
unlawful public accommodations discrimination, including national origin
discrimination in the provision of city services. The Commissioners have
violated the FPO by discriminating against LEP Asian American voters in the
administration of elections, a city service.

Nancy Nguyen, Branch Manager of BPSOS-Delaware Valley, an organizational
plaintiff that  had urged the Commissioners to provide Asian language access,
said, “Language should not be a barrier for any individual who wishes to
exercise his or her protected right to vote as a citizen of this country. We
watched person after person being turned away at the polls in multiple elections
due to language barriers. A vote lost is a voice silenced–we cannot allow this
to continue.”

The Commissioners provided only four Asian language interpreters for the entire
city of Philadelphia for the 2012 Presidential Election, despite a history of
documented need for Asian language interpreters in particular areas, such as
South Philadelphia.

Rahat N. Babar, APABA-PA President, said, “As we approach the 50th anniversary
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we must ensure that all citizens, regardless
of national origin, can meaningfully exercise their fundamental right to vote.
This complaint seeks to protect Philadelphia’s most vulnerable voters.”

Vattamala said:  “Asian LEP voters in Philadelphia will continue to experience
unlawful public accommodations discrimination without an order of relief from
the PCHR.”
