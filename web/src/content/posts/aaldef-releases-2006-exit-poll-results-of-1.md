#### Findings Illuminate Asian American Voting Patterns, Voter Priorities for 2008 Elections, Vote for Governor, and Voting Barriers

Boston, MAâ€”Today, the **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund** (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its multilingual exit poll of hundreds of Asian American voters in **Massachusetts** during the November 2006 gubernatorial elections. AALDEF, a 33-year-old civil rights organization, polled more than 4,700 Asian American voters in 23 cities and in nine states on Election Day nationwide, conducting the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind.

**AALDEF Staff Attorney Glenn Magpantay** presented detailed findings from the 2006 Massachusetts exit poll with comparative information in the following areas:

* Voter priorities for the 2008 Elections
* Party enrollment and voting history
* Vote for Massachusetts governor
* Ethnicity and national origin
* Opinions about immigration reform
* Citizenship tenure (duration)
* English proficiency levels
* Voting barriers and problems

AALDEF's multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. Nearly 11,000 Asian American voters in eight states and 3,000 in four states were surveyed in the 2004 and 2002 exit polls, respectively. More than 30 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans.

Co-sponsors of the April 30 presentation include Asian Pacific American Agenda Coalition, Asian American Lawyers Association of Massachusetts, Chinese Progressive Association, Greater Boston Legal Services Asian Outreach Unit, MassVOTE, ONE Lowell, and Vietnamese American Initiative for Development.

**The majority of Asian Americans voted for Democratic candidate Deval Patrick for Massachusetts governor.**

Three out of four (75%) Asian American voters supported Democratic candidate Deval Patrick in his bid for governor. Twenty-one percent (21%) voted for Republican candidate Kerry Healey, and four percent (4%) voted for other candidates. Among the total electorate, Patrick won 56% of the vote, while Healey won 35%.
