CBS Radio has given the boot to shock jocks Jeff Vandergrift and Dan Lay and their WFNY FreeFM show, “The Dog House with JV and Elvis,” after they aired a segment in April ridiculing Chinese restaurant employees in a prank phone call using **racist, sexist, and homophobic taunts**.

On April 26, AALDEF Executive Director Margaret Fung wrote a [letter to WFNY](/uploads/pdf/CBS-Doghouseltr2007-4-26.pdf) urging CBS to fire the DJs, calling their initial suspension from the airwaves “inadequate.” 

The Organization of Chinese Americans, AALDEF, and a coalition of Asian American and concerned community groups met with CBS executives on May 4 to express their outrage and demand that CBS terminate the show.
