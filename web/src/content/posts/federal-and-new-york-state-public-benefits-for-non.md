Since Non-Immigrant Persons are authorized to reside in the U.S. for a limited
period of time for limited purposes, such as students or tourists, non-immigrant
persons cannot receive most federal public benefits that are based on their need
and income level. Similarly, Undocumented Persons can receive very few public
benefits since they have no valid immigration records or papers. For any of
these benefits, there may be restrictions that you may have to meet in order to
receive the benefit. Please consult a social worker or an attorney to learn more
about these requirements and to find out whether you satisfy these requirements
to receive the benefits.

**FEDERAL PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR NON-IMMIGRANTS AND UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS:**

* Emergency Medicaid
* Non-cash Short-term Emergency Disaster Relief
* Public Health Assistance for immunization and to test and treat communicable diseases
* Some Community Service Programs needed to protect life or safety (e.g. short term shelter and housing, assistance for homeless, violence prevention programs, community nutritional programs, and medical and public health services)
* Some Housing/Community Development Programs

**NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS:**

* Health Care assistance for Emergency Medical Conditions (not organ transplants)

regardless of your undocumented status.
