**2007 Honoree Biographies**

**Javade Chaudhri:** One of the few South Asian American attorneys to serve as general counsel of a Fortune 500 company, Chaudhri is responsible for overseeing all major legal matters for Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based company with 14,000 employees and more than 29 million customers worldwide. Before joining Sempra Energy in 2003, Chaudhri served as general counsel of Gateway Inc., as a senior partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Winston & Strawn, and a partner at Jones Day. He has been a visiting faculty member for the International Development Law Organization in Rome and the International Law Institute in D.C. Chaudhris pro bono commitments include promoting economic development in developing countries and emerging democracies. He is receiving the Justice in Action Award for his longstanding commitment to diversity and his outstanding legal achievements. **Elwood Lui**, a partner at Jones Day and former California Supreme Court Justice, will present the Award to Chaudhri.

**Nicholas deB. Katzenbach:** As Attorney General of the United States under President Lyndon B. Johnson, Katzenbach helped to bring about the passage of the most successful civil rights laws in American history: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1966, Katzenbach successfully defended the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act twice before the U.S. Supreme Court. Congress later cited the Court’s decision in _Katzenbach v. Morgan_ when it amended the Voting Rights Act in 1975 to include language assistance provisions—which have since benefited hundreds of thousands of Asian American voters who are not yet fluent in English. Katzenbach, as Deputy Attorney General in the Kennedy Administration, enforced court orders compelling the University of Mississippi and the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa to enroll their first African American students. After leaving government service, he served as General Counsel of IBM from 1969 to 1986. He is receiving the Justice in Action Award for his pivotal role in enforcing the civil rights of all Americans. **Harold Hongju Koh**, Yale Law School Dean and 1993 AALDEF Justice in Action Award recipient, will present the Award to Katzenbach.

**Helen Zia:** An award-winning journalist and activist, Zia one of the Asian American community’s most influential voices for social justice and political empowerment. She is the author of _Asian American Dreams: The Emergence of an American People_, and the co-author, with Dr. Wen Ho Lee, of _My Country Versus Me_, a first-hand account about the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of being a spy for China. In 1982, after the racially-motivated beating death of Vincent Chin by two unemployed white automobile workers, Zia helped to launch a national campaign to call for justice and a federal civil rights prosecution of Chin’s assailants. Zia’s efforts were recounted in the Academy Award-nominated documentary film, “Who Killed Vincent Chin?” by Christine Choy and Renee Tajima-Peña. Zia was recently profiled in the acclaimed PBS documentary by Bill Moyers, “Becoming American: The Chinese Experience.” She is receiving the Justice in Action Award for her insightful writing about the Asian American community and her advocacy efforts to promote social justice. **Carol Jenkins**, president of the Women’s Media Center, will present the Award to Zia.

ABC News Correspondent **Juju Chang** will be M.C. for the evening’s festivities. Photographs of the honorees are available upon request.
