Equal Justice Works Fellow Aparna Garg’s letter to the editor was published in
response to a  Time magazine column by Joel Stein, “My Own Private India,” (July
5),
[https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1999416,00.html](https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1999416,00.html)

As an attorney for South Asian immigrant workers in New Jersey, I am offended by
Stein’s failed attempt to poke fun at Indian Americans through racist
stereotypes. Three decades ago, New Jersey’s Indian American community faced a
wave of hate violence, including murder, which led to the passage of the state’s
hate-crimes law. Hate violence is never a laughing matter.
