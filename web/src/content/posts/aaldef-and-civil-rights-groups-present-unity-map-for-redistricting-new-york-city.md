The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), LatinoJustice
PRLDEF, National Institute for Latino Policy (NILP), and the Center for Law and
Social Justice (CLSJ) of Medgar Evers College have released the **Unity Map**, a
joint proposal for new State Assembly and State Senate districts in New York
City that reflects its changing demographics and protects the voting rights of
Blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans. “Each of these groups — Asian Americans,
Latinos, and Blacks — has a history of being underrepresented and has endured a
long string of voting rights violations,” said Esmeralda Simmons, Executive
Director of CLSJ. “Out of common respect, we have joined together and have
created maps for the common good.”

**How the New Districts Were Proposed**

All four organizations agreed on an overarching set of criteria in drafting the Unity Map.

* Adhering to the “One Person-One Vote” requirement of the U. S. Constitution by maintaining a nearly uniform legal level of deviation for all the districts.
* Following the Voting Rights Act to ensure that New York City’s “racial minority” populations have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process.
* Protecting “communities of interest,” or groups of people that share common socioeconomic characteristics, languages, and cultures.
* Preserving both traditional and emerging neighborhoods.

**What the Unity Map Accomplishes**

In the past decade, Asian Americans were among the fastest growing racial
minority groups in New York City. Nonetheless, they remain one of the most
underrepresented politically. There are no Asian American representatives in the
State Senate and only one in the State Assembly. This incongruity results from
the fact that large Asian American communities are severely split among
different districts. For example, the Richmond Hill/South Ozone Park community
is divided among six assembly districts.

“Given the rapid Asian American population growth over the last decade, new
legislative districts must be drawn to enable our community to participate
effectively in the political process,” said AALDEF Executive Director Margaret
Fung. “Our goal of keeping ‘communities of interest’ together is of particular
importance to Asian Americans. We want to ensure that Asian Americans in New
York City will not lose their political voice because they are kept apart by
district lines.”

By keeping such communities of interest together, the Unity Map achieves four
Asian American majority State Assembly districts, and one majority Asian
American State Senate district in the neighborhood of Flushing/Bayside.

Latinos constituted 27.5% of the total population in New York City, according to
the 2010 Census. “New York City is home to an incredible diversity of Latino
elected officials of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Ecuadoran lineage,” said Juan
Cartagena, President and General Counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF. “But at the
same time its Latino communities are embedded within contorted district lines
that were fashioned long ago to protect non-Latino incumbents – some of whom
have not been consistently responsive to the community’s needs.”

Under the Unity Map, there will be sixteen Latino majority State Assembly
districts rather than the current thirteen, and seven majority State Senate
districts rather than the current five. “Latinos can gain additional
opportunities to elect candidates of their choice without unnecessarily
infringing upon the rights of other protected groups,” said Cartagena. “This
plan for NY State Senate and Assembly strives to do just that – and for the
betterment of all New Yorkers.”

The Unity Map also preserves the number of Black districts in the State Assembly
and State Senate while simultaneously expanding the number of districts in Asian
American and Latino American communities, in accordance with their population
growth.

“The districts that we have drawn are meaningful for Black communities – they
give Black communities the ability to elect the candidates of their choice,”
said Simmons. “In addition, we have not split communities when the population
size of a community is too small to justify a separate district. Thus, we have
protected vulnerable ‘communities of interest.'”

**The Upcoming Vote**

Our groups are taking action by using this once-in-a-decade opportunity to
redraw district lines. To that end, AALDEF, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, NILP, and CLSJ
have submitted the Unity Map to the New York State Legislative Task Force on
Demographic Research and Reapportionment (LATFOR), which is conducting public
hearings before presenting its proposed maps to the New York State Legislature
and the Governor. “These lines show the New York State Legislature and the
governor what is possible to create during 2011 redistricting if they strive to
protect the voting rights of Blacks, Latinos, and Asians Americans,” said
Simmons.
