On Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017, 12 noon to 1:30 pm, AALDEF will conduct a DACA
Renewal Training Webinar for pro bono lawyers, in conjunction with the Asian
American Bar Association of New York (AABANY).

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Sept. 5, 2017, the rescission and
“winding down” of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which
provided temporary protection from deportation and employment authorization for
close to 800,000 undocumented young immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

Please join AALDEF and AABANY for a webinar on Sept. 19 at 12 noon ET. This is a
free training for attorneys who are interested in volunteering to assist DACA
beneficiaries who must meet a filing deadline of Oct. 5, 2017 to renew their
deferred action and work authorization. The training will run approximately 1.5
hours and will be led by Annie J. Wang , a staff attorney at AALDEF’s Immigrant
Access to Justice project, and Amanda Bernardo, an immigration attorney in
private practice and a co-chair of AABANY’s Immigration Committee, and will
focus on what you need to know in order to help current DACA recipients complete
and submit renewal applications.  See below to register NOW for an online
training session for DACA renewal clinic volunteers.

AABANY and AALDEF will also hold a pro bono DACA renewal clinic on Sunday
afternoon, October 1.  Details below.
