AALDEF submitted a joint letter with New York Immigration Coalition, Internationals Network for Public Schools, and Advocates for Children of New York to the U.S. Department of Education, expressing its support for the New York State Education Department’s requested ESEA waiver amendments regarding testing for English Language Learners (ELLs). The groups support the use of the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test as a better way to assess the progress of ELLs during the first two years of their instruction in the U.S. You can read a copy of the letter [here](/uploads/pdf/Support%20for%20NYSED%20ESEA%20Waiver%20Amendments%209%2019%2014.pdf).
