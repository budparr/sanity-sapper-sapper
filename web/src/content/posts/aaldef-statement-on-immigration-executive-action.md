Tonight, President Obama announced his plan to provide administrative relief to
certain groups of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The
following is a statement by Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian
American Legal Defense and Education Fund:

“We welcome President Obama’s use of executive authority to provide relief from
deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants and their families.The  Asian
American population nationwide is 19 million, and close to 1.5 million are
undocumented. Current deportation and detention policies have separated Asian
American families, harmed low-wage workers, and created fear and mistrust of
local law enforcement. With the continued failure of Congress to enact
comprehensive legislation, President Obama’s action to delay the deportation of
millions of undocumented immigrants is long overdue.

In our [exit poll](/press-release/aaldef-2014-exit-poll-shows-asian-american-voters-support-executive-action-on-immigration/) of 4,100 Asian American voters in the 2014 midterm elections, 65% expressed their support for executive action on immigration. The measures announced tonight are an important step in the right direction, in order to ensure that the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws adheres to human rights principles and reflects American values of fairness and family unity.

The omission of large numbers of undocumented immigrants with strong ties to the
U.S., such as the parents of immigrants who have been granted Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), is disappointing. AALDEF will continue to support
organizing and advocacy efforts that seek long-term solutions to our unworkable
immigration policies. Such actions will pave the way for Asian immigrants and
their families to gain a pathway to citizenship, contribute more fully to their
communities and to our country as a whole, and protect the rights of all
Americans, both native-born and immigrants.
