AALDEF and the Southeast Asia and Action Resource Center (SEARAC) have submitted joint comments to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) regarding its agency plan to improve the quality of life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as specified by Executive Order 13515. Our comments, submitted on behalf of twenty national and local Asian American groups, offer recommendations for strengthening the DOE’s efforts to disaggregate data by ethnicity, combat bias-based harassment, improve access to the Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI) program, and better serve English Language Learners (ELLs).

  AALDEF also signed onto comments submitted to DOE by the Sikh Coalition, which included recommendations to address bullying of Asian American youth and compliance reviews for school districts with vulnerable Asian American populations.
