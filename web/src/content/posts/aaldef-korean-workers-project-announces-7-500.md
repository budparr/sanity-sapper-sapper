Flushing, NY—Today, two Korean day laborers represented by the Korean Workers Project, **Mr. Park** and **Mr. Lee**, received the balance of a $7,500 settlement with **Mr. Younghan Kim** for back wages and unpaid overtime. Mr. Kim failed to pay them for a significant portion of their promised wages, and also did not pay them any overtime despite the fact that both employees consistently worked more than 40 hours per week.

Mr. Park and Mr. Lee worked as carpenters and construction workers for Mr. Kim in the Bronx and Manhattan from March through July 2005. They generally worked six days a week from 8:00am to 6:00pm. Mr. Park performed general construction duties for Mr. Kim, including furnishing interiors and building work stations on a beauty school located in the Bronx. Mr. Lee also performed general construction duties, including carpentry on buildings in the Bronx and Manhattan. 

“The construction industry often relies on illegal practices and exploits workers to keep costs low,” said **AALDEF Staff Attorney and Korean Workers Project Director Steven Choi**, who represented the workers. This settlement is a victory for all day laborers, especially construction workers who are wrongfully taken advantage of by their employers. We want to send the message that no matter the industry, employment laws cannot simply be ignored.

Mr. Kim owed Mr. Park approximately **$3,000** and Mr. Lee approximately **$9,800**. The workers sought legal assistance from the Korean Workers Project, which helped them file a federal suit to reclaim their wages in November 2005 and win a settlement in 2006.

The Korean Workers Project provides traditional direct legal services free of charge to low-wage Korean immigrant workers through AALDEF, in conjunction with YKASECEmpowering the Korean American Community, and offers community education and outreach efforts. By combining these two approaches, the Korean Workers Project seeks to protect the rights of Korean immigrant workers and to help them achieve social and economic justice.
