AALDEF is seeking volunteers to conduct land use surveys of Chinatown in Boston as part of a multi-city project focused on the health and sustainability of Chinatowns and surrounding communities.

Volunteers will survey all the addresses on specified streets â€“ generally 3 to 4 city blocks. Using the survey, volunteers will collect information about the type of businesses, parking spaces, etc. on a particular street. The survey requires volunteers to look at buildings and record what exists; the survey does not require speaking with residents or storeowners. This process will take approximately 2 to 3 hours. You can choose when you want to conduct the survey, but a 45 minute training is required prior to conducting the survey.

If you are interested in volunteering, email us at housingjustice@aaldef.org indicating:  
1.  Name  
2.  Contact information  
3.  Preferred training date from the below list  
4.  Any language ability in Chinese (not required to conduct the land use survey)

Land use survey training dates and times:

Training Location: Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, 38 Ash Street, Boston 

Saturday, March 12: 12pm (Room 501/508)  
Monday, March 14: 1pm and 6pm (Room 505)

If you have a group that would like to conduct the survey, we can also arrange trainings specifically for your group. For more information, call Bethany Li at 212.966.5932 x213 or email us at: housingjustice@aaldef.org.
