#### Findings Illuminate Asian American Voter Priorities for 2008 Elections, Political Party Registration, and Need for Compliance with Voter Language Assistance

Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its multilingual exit poll of hundreds of Asian American voters in New York during the November 2006 midterm elections. AALDEF, a 33-year-old civil rights organization, polled more than 4,700 Asian American voters in 23 cities and in nine states on Election Day, the largest nonpartisan survey of its kind. In New York, AALDEF surveyed a total of 2,386 Asian American voters. Respondents were surveyed in Flushing, Chinatown, Floral Park, Jackson Heights, Kensington, Elmhurst, Jamaica, Sunnyside, Midwood, and Richmond Hill.

AALDEF Voting Rights Public Education Coordinator Brian Redondo and Staff Attorney Glenn Magpantay presented detailed findings from the 2006 New York exit poll with comparative information in the following areas:

* Voter priorities for the 2008
* Elections
* Party enrollment and voting history
* Vote for State Attorney General
* Ethnicity and national origin
* Opinions about immigration reform
* Citizenship tenure (duration)
* English proficiency levels
* Language access needs by ethnicity

AALDEF's multilingual exit polls reveal vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys. AALDEF has conducted exit polls of Asian American voters in every major election since 1988. Nearly 11,000 Asian American voters in eight states and 3,000 in four states were surveyed in the 2004 and 2002 exit polls, respectively. More than 30 community groups and organizations joined AALDEF to mobilize more than 600 attorneys, law students, and volunteers to conduct the exit poll and to safeguard the voting rights of Asian Americans.

Co-sponsors of the May 17 presentation include the Asian American Bar Association of New York, Asian Pacific American Voters Alliance, Chinese American Voter Association, Filipino American Human Services, Inc., Korean American Voters Council of NY/NJ, Korean American League for Civic Action, The Sikh Coalition, Legal Access Network for South Asians, South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow, South Asian Youth Action!, YKASECEmpowering the Korean American Community.
