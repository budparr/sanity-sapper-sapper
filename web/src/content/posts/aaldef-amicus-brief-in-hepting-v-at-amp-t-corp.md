On May 4, AALDEF joined other national civil rights organizations in filing an amicus brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the National Security Agencyâ€™s practice of wiretapping without warrant or oversight is unconstitutional.

Organizations joining the brief in the case of Hepting v. AT&T Corp. are the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Japanese American Citizens League, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and United for Peace and Justice.
