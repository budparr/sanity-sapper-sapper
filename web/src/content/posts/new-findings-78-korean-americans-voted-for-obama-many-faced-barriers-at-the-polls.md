Today, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) released detailed findings from its multilingual exit poll of 998 Korean American voters in the November 2012 elections, the largest survey of its kind in the nation. The results indicated that Korean Americans showed strong support for comprehensive immigration reform and the Democratic party candidates for President and Congress.

78% of Korean Americans polled voted for President Obama, compared to 77% of those polled nationally. Of those surveyed, 60% were enrolled in the Democratic party, while only 14% were enrolled in the Republican party, and 24% indicated that they were not enrolled in any party. The majority of Korean Americans (72%) supported immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.

AALDEF conducted the exit polls in states with large Korean American populations, which included New York, Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, and Massachusetts. The exit poll results are part of AALDEF’s [14-state multilingual exit poll of 9,096 Asian American voters](/press-release/aaldef-election-monitoring-sandy-14-state-exit-poll-2012/).

During the November 2012 elections, many Korean American voters encountered [barriers at polling places](/press-release/asian-americans-report-voting-barriers-and-discrimination-at-poll-sites-across-usa/), including segregated voting lines in Annandale, Virginia and voters who were not allowed to vote in Georgia because they had not provided documentary proof of U.S. citizenship under Georgia’s new proof of citizenship law.

“Due to issues that Korean American voters encountered, AALDEF calls on the Governor of Virginia to veto the bills SB 1256 and HB 1337, which restrict the forms of acceptable identification that voters may present at elections polls, and will prevent hundreds of thousands of eligible Virginians from voting,” said Glenn Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program.

Magpantay presented the results of the 2012 exit poll on Korean American voters at the Yejin Korean Community Service Center in Annandale.
