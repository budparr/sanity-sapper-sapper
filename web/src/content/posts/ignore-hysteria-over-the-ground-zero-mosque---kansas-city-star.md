There is no “ground zero mosque.”

Despite widespread hysteria from politicians and the media, there is no mosque
being built at Ground Zero. I should know; I work a few blocks away. What is
being built is called Park51, a Muslim community center located on Park Place, a
busy street in lower Manhattan blocks away from Ground Zero. Park51 is modeled
after the YMCA, and will have a gym, swimming pool, auditorium, culinary school,
and yes, a prayer room. It will be open to members of all faiths who live, work,
and visit lower Manhattan.

The opposition to Park51, including E. Thomas McClanahan’s op-ed “Building a
mosque at Ground Zero is distasteful,” is based on the false and hurtful premise
that Islam and America’s 7 million Muslims are inextricably linked to the 9/11
terrorist attacks carried out by 19 extremists.

This could not be further from the truth. In fact, Al Qaida has killed more
Muslims than members of any other religion. As an American and a Muslim, Al
Qaida is a common enemy for all, including more than 1 billion Muslims around
the world. Why should we be held responsible for the heinous acts of a crazy and
despicable few?

As founders of the Crescent Peace Society, my parents have worked for years
throughout the Greater Kansas City area to enhance the understanding of Muslim
cultures and dispel connections between Islam and violence and other
misunderstandings of our faith. It is people like my parents and me who
represent the vast majority of Muslims in the United States, and we strive daily
to live in peace and harmony with our neighbors.

Why support the construction of Park51? It serves a need for thousands of
Muslims, like myself, who work and live here, and do not have a proper place to
practice our faith. Muslims have been in lower Manhattan for centuries. African
Muslim slaves were buried at the African Burial Ground just blocks from Ground
Zero. Dozens of local Muslims died in the attacks. Hundreds more, including
police and firefighters, volunteered to help the injured and the needy. Before
Park51, two small mosques existed in lower Manhattan without controversy for
decades. During Friday prayers and Muslim holidays like Ramadan, they routinely
turn away congregants. Park51 will offer an adequate, peaceful place to pray and
contemplate our relationship with God.

As a community center, Park51 will also serve a huge need for people of all
faiths who live and work in the area, with its variety of services and
activities (Manhattan’s YMCAs and Jewish Community Centers are located further
north). That is why the local Community Board’s Financial District Committee
voted unanimously to support the project.

McClanahan says that Muslims should “accept an alternative site.” But I ask him,
how many blocks does he want me to travel so I can practice my religion?
