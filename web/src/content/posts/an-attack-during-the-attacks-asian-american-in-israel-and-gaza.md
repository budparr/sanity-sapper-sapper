In my California, home of the severe drought, I grew up listening to the Beach
Boys and the dream of an “endless summer.”

I can’t imagine this summer in Israel and Gaza, home of what appears to be the
“endless war.”

Actually, thanks to the media reports, I don’t have to imagine the war. I see it
played out on the news, where the real “negotiations” seem to be taking place.
Hamas’ rockets into Israel; Israel’s massive counterattack in populated areas,
including schools.

Was it all about the missing teens, Hamas’ launchers and its tunnels of war?

Everyone seems to have a cover story to justify the violence meted out.

At this point, the score is not good. More than 1,900 Palestinians, the majority
civilians, are dead. Israel claims 67 casualties. It’s enough to keep the
politicians addicted to war entrenched in their positions. But even one death
has been too many.

As I write, we are in the tail end of a cease-fire and at the beginning of some
preliminary discussions. I hope we go further down that peaceful path.

But at this juncture, there doesn’t seem to be light at the end of that tunnel.

Not yet, at least.

When the current iteration of tumult over Israel and Gaza began, I contacted an
old friend of mine, an Asian American and a former partner with a major law
firm. He married his college sweetheart, an Israeli, and has relocated
permanently to Israel to be with her family.

The harassment of Hamas, and Israel’s massive counterattack, coincided with an
attack of his own–on his heart, what my friend described as a “mild myocardial
infarction.”

He e-mailed me:

> It was an existential moment. And I’m in good shape, but apparently not so in

> Hamas is. I know that Israel takes a beating from the lib/leftist/Jon Stewart

> Even though I didn’t expect to hear a few verses of Pete Seeger from my friend,
> his hard line was still a surprise.
>
> Whatever Netanyahu was doing in Israel to whip up support for his actions seemed

My friend’s e-mail continued:

When the first cease-fire was announced and then broken almost as soon as it
began, my friend was not optimistic and predicted what would happen.

> I doubt whether the cease-fire will hold. Hamas will throw up some rockets. The

He was right.

My friend’s view of the future:

> Hamas will hold out until at least the 34th day. Why? Because it will be one day
> longer than the 2006 Lebanon War. Hamas wants to declare that it outlasted the
> Israelis and fought longer than Hezbollah. There may well be an eventual

I hope he’s wrong.

In the meantime, the war has become a kind of litmus test among friends. My
pro-Israel friends have become even more hawkish. Some make sense. Other friends
remind me that the Palestinians are also, by continent, an Asian people, being
oppressed and bullied.

Where do you stand?

I’ve found it isn’t really whether one is pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian. Nor is
it about who is oppressing whom, though the fact is, despite Israel’s withdrawal
from Gaza in 2005, a blockaded Gaza with border restrictions essentially remains
“occupied.”

It’s not even whether one is conservative or liberal.

It’s really just about hawks vs. doves.

And so far the hawks are winning.

When President Obama said this week that he had “no sympathy for Hamas, but
sympathy for the ordinary people of Gaza,” it was a newsworthy statement. After
weeks of unquestioned support for Israel, both rhetorically and financially, he
began to show an important recognition of the humanity of the Palestinians.

This week, Obama also spoke of “formulas” that are available to reach that goal
of a two-state solution.

“But they’re going to require risks on the part of political leaders,” the
president said. “They’re going to require a slow rebuilding of trust in the
aftermath of the violence we have seen.”

The leaders of both sides aren’t used to taking risks for peace. Both sides
preferred the violence to restock the hate that fuels the endless war.

In the Middle East, all the players seem inclined toward the “long game.” It may
mean the best we can hope for is to manage the hate and intolerance, and simply
trust that “this too shall pass.”

I’d rather they give peace a real chance.
