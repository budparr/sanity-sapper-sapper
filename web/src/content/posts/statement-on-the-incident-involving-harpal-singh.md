Our organizations jointly issue this statement to express our collective concern over the events that led to the cutting of Harpal Singh Vachers hair, a religious article of the Sikh faith, on May 25, 2007. 

Our schools should be a place where our differences are celebrated, not a point of division among our children. We call upon the Department of Education to work with our communities to ensure that all South Asian children, and indeed all children, in our public schools are safe and free from harassment or bias. School administrators, teachers, and safety professionals should work immediately to ensure that our children are able to focus on their education in school, and put in place measures to ensure all youth are taught respect and appreciation for diversity.

We also call upon all members of the South Asian community—all religions, all nationalities—to come together to ensure our children appreciate each others differences. Harpals tragedy should not be a point of division within our community. 

Our community-based organizations are acting to ensure that our schools and our communities work together to guarantee a safer and brighter future for children in our community. What happened with Harpal should never happen again.
