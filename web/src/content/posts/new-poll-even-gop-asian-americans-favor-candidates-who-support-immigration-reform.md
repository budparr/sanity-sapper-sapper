According to new results of an exit poll released today by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), more than half (52%) of voters polled in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York said they would be likely to vote for a candidate for Congress who supported comprehensive immigration reform.  More Republican Asian American voters (39%) prefer candidates who support immigration reform than those who prefer candidates against immigration reform (22%), with 39% neutral. Majority support was also consistent whether voters supported Democratic or Republican candidates.

“Preference for candidates who support immigration reform is high within the politically diverse, independent Asian American community,” said Glenn D. Magpantay, Director of AALDEF’s Democracy Program.  “GOP candidates would likely gain even among registered Republican Asian American voters by supporting immigration reform.”

The nonpartisan multilingual exit poll of 2,290 Asian American voters was [conducted](/press-release/asian-group-to-monitor-polls-and-poll-voters-in-ny-nj-and-va-on-election-day/) by AALDEF at 24 poll sites after the mayoral election in New York and the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. The poll found high numbers of Asian American voters (67%) supported immigration reform including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including 68% in New York, 68% in New Jersey, and 65% in Virginia.
