The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) is releasing an initial set of Frequently Asked Questions on the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case on race-conscious college admissions, _Fisher v. Texas_. These questions are based on common questions and misconceptions regarding how diversity considerations affect the Asian American community that AALDEF has encountered since [announcing its _amicus_ brief][2] in support of race-conscious admissions.

AALDEF is releasing this initial set with an invitation for public comments and suggestions for additional FAQ responses, with the intention of using these responses to further develop the FAQs as a definitive and accessible resource for the Asian American community on college diversity.

“The majority of Asian Americans [support][3] diversity considerations in public decision-making,” said Khin Mai Aung, Director of the Educational Equity Program at AALDEF. “With so much at stake in _Fisher v. Texas_, we want to ensure that we have an ongoing and open dialogue with the Asian American community about how diversity in college impacts them.”

The [current FAQs][1] include:

-   The current law on considering race in college admissions
-   Myths about SAT gaps between Asian Americans and other races
-   A discussion of race factors versus class factors
-   The effects of banning the use of diversity considerations
-   And more

“Speaking directly to our community and clarifying any existing misconceptions about race-conscious admissions will encourage even more Asian Americans to unite in favor of diversity,” said Aung.
