**“Tracked in America: Stories from the History of U.S. Government Surveillance,”** a newly launched online documentary, marks the most comprehensive effort to examine the history of surveillance in America. Featured on the site are the personal stories of 25 individuals affected by surveillance and six historians who chronicle surveillance and dissent in America from 1798 to today. 

In the documentarys first-person audio accounts, a range of people describe their experiences with surveillance through different periods of U.S. history: World War I and World War II, the Red Scares of the McCarthy era, the civil rights movement, protests against the Vietnam War, the sanctuary movement of the 1980s, and our current post-9/11 era. 

The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund is proud to join in the promotion of the site and invites you to visit the free documentary [here][1].
