We were all having so much fun, too. But that’s no excuse for racism.

I was wondering when someone would use a “Chink in the Armor” reference.

I’m sure many Asian Americans thought about it too. But only the most screwed up
Asian American self-hater would use it in public to describe the basketball
flaws of Jeremy Lin.

It’s not so bad if we were all living in Medieval America and people  actually
bought their chain maille and armor from Barney’s and Macy’s. Then, hey, sure,
it might be OK. When you get a ding in your metal suit, that’s a drag. We all
can relate.

But the dark ages are gone. We live in a diverse America, and when you say
“Chink,” you are not bringing the love. Nor are you talking about the flaws of
Sir Lancelot, real or imagined.

Still, if someone likened Lin’s ball-handling to Lancelot trying a crossover
move in full armor, you might make a case for “plausible deniability.”

But let’s face it.

We all know what someone means when they say “Chink” in reference to Jeremy Lin.

The media, in this case the headline writers at ESPN, have been so giddy with
Linsanity, they must have thought it gave everyone the green light to have some
racist fun.

Editors surely would have taken more care to blurt the “N” word. But evidently
not the “C” word.

The good fun of Linsanity is intended to make people realize how inclusive the
world has become.

It’s not intended to desensitize us all to the racist sentiments of the past.

ESPN has apologized for the slur, but that isn’t enough.

The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund is [calling for full apologies][1] on ESPN cablecasts. The network needs to set the record straight
for all to hear, lest anyone get the idea that slurs on Asian Americans are OK.
