In the 2016 Presidential Election, 13,846 Asian American voters participated in the nation’s largest nonpartisan multilingual exit poll, conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF). The Asian American Exit Poll was conducted in 11 Asian languages and English in 55 cities across 14 states – NY, NJ, MA, PA, VA, MD, MI, GA, LA, FL, TX, NV, NM, and CA – and Washington, DC. The exit poll reveals vital information about Asian American voting patterns that is often overlooked in mainstream voter surveys.

At this special presentation, comparative information will be given about the Asian American vote in the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections, concerns about key issues, first-time voters, and profiles of the Asian American vote by ethnicity, nativity, party enrollment, age, gender, religion and English proficiency.
