  AFFECTED BUT NEGLECTED: The Impact of 9/11 on Community Health and A Call for Federal Action 

  A TOWN HALL FORUM THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 7, 2006 6:30-8:30pm St. Pauls Chapel Broadway Between Fulton & Vesey Sts.  

  Ground Zero workers have suffered severe 9/11 health impacts and our government must take immediate action to meet their needs.

  Less recognized is the health impact of 9/11 on the community. After 9/11, medical researchers found the rate of respiratory illness among downtown residents had tripled.

  What are the health needs of people exposed to contamination from the destruction of the World Trade Center? Shouldnt there be a federally funded screening and treatment program for all affected residents, office workers, students and visitors?

  Join us, as we hear from medical experts and community members on the health effects of 9/11 contamination and launch a drive for the federal government to address these unmet community health needs.

  Speak out from the audience about your 9/11 health experiences and concerns.
