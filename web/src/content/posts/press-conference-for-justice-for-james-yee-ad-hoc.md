**Summary:** On Tuesday, August 3, 2004, Chaplain James Yee had made public his resignation from the U.S. Army. The chaplain, an army captain as well, was wrongfully arrested last September 11 and was detained for 76 days through allegations that he was linked to a possible espionage ring while working in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In March, all criminal charges were dropped and shortly afterwards, the administrative reprimand was reversed by military officials.
