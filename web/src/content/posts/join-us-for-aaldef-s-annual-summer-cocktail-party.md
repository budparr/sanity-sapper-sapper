Kick off your summer in style! Join AALDEF at one of the City's finest nightclubs on **Wednesday, June 13** with hundreds of other professionals.

The **Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF)** will hold its annual Summer Cocktail Party at **HOME**—532 West 27th Street between 10th & 11th Avenues—from **6 to 9 p.m.**

Located in West Chelsea, HOME is an A-list destination in one of the City’s hottest neighborhoods. Roomy and refined, partygoers will feel right at home, with plush couches, crystal chandeliers, and leather-lined ceilings.

This is your chance to network with other young New York-area professionals. Last years party drew 500 guests from all walks of life—legal, finance, fashion, media, entertainment and non-profit.

Tickets to the event are $50, and the evening includes a raffle, light hors doeuvres, live DJ, and cash bar. RSVP by June 8, 2007. For ticket information, please email [events@aaldef.org](mailto:events@aaldef.org) or call 212-966-5932 x212.
